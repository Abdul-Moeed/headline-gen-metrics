After reading reviews and taking measurements I ended up going with the large size (the color was the closest matching for my patio).  It doesn't fit like a glove but it isn't too loose (Maybe 1-2\" too big length wise). I was worried about the depth not being enough but there isn't an issue there. It hangs about a 1/2 inch off the ground (lower than the Weber cover). Towards the first snow I'll tighten up the bottom strap. It has survived a few normal rain/thunderstorms without blowing off and protected the grill.I'll update my review in the future.[Update April, 2014]The cover survived a harsh cold winter, and more importantly my grill survived.

        "reviewText": "I've owned several grill covers in my lifetime, and none of them quite stacked up to the quality, durability, and design of this one.  Yes, it is heavy weight, which one would expect of a premium grill cover.  But the quality does not stop here.  It is sewn well with stitching that seems to be built to last.  But what really makes this grill cover stand out to me are the unique features that you will not find in most grill covers.  First, the straps that can be secured around each leg of your grill are ingenious.  This means no more improvised inventions to keep the cover on your grill in storms or high winds.  You need not secure the cover on all 4 corners, but even one or two corners will ensure that it's not going anywhere when the wind starts blowing.  The zippered pocket that faces the front is pretty cool.  I am not sure what I will keep in there, but it's a neat feature.  Lastly, though I have seen them on some other covers, too, the sturdy handles for lifting and positioning the grill cover are great.  Again, they seem to be built with longevity in mind.  One quality that is too early to test is whether the cover will fade or discolor in the sun so badly, like other grill covers I have owned.  My only minor complaint is probably my own fault.  I own a Char Broil grill with a griddle on one side of the fire box and a shelf on the other side.  I thought for sure I should get the XL cover, but it actually seems a bit TOO LARGE.  I can live with it, though.  You might want to actually measure your grill, rather than guessing, as I did. TL;DR:",

Over the years, I have paid the same amount and more for grill covers with nowhere near the quality of this one. The package states that the main body is 100% woven polyester with laminated polyvinyl chloride backing and a hem casing of 100% polyester. The seams are double stitched, as well as the handles which make removing the cover easy. The cinch cord on the bottom has kept it from blowing off in several very strong wind gusts. You'll want to make allowances for the fact that sizes seem to run large.

The generous size covers the full length & width of the smoker and nearly the entire height, leaving only the bottom of the legs exposed. Because the grill cover was designed for a normally shaped grill, we knew there would be sections that didn't fit snugly and expected to have to use bungee cords to secure the bottom of the cover. To our surprise, the straps sewn into the bottom of the cover pull tightly enough to keep it in place. We have strong south winds, routinely gusting more than 35 mph for extended periods of time and so far, we've only had to adjust the cover & retighten the straps once. And even though it had loosened, the cover did not blow off.So far, the only element that has blasted the cover is wind; though we have had rain, it hasn't been prolonged and no hail, ice, snow yet. Given the quality construction of this cover, I am feeling pretty positive that it will hold up to the worst mother nature throws its way. Will update later if I am proven wrong. TL;DR:",

I bought theChar-Broil 65\" Artisan Grill Cover - Mountain Greenfor it when I bought the grill, but it was a little shorter than the grill, although it fit well otherwise. I decided to try the X-Large Classic Accessories 55-142-055101-EC Ravenna Grill Cover in taupe with myChar-Broil 4-Burner 48,000 BTU Gas Grill, with Side burner.The Ravenna cover is plain, but still attractive. More importantly, it feels and looks very durable, which is exactly what I want to cover a grill outside. It is large enough that there is no part of the grill exposed to the elements, and the bottom tightens up to keep the fit snug. The Char-Broil cover had a tendency to blow half off of the grill when it was windy, but the Ravenna cover has stayed put even with the storms we've had here lately.I checked the grill after one storm subsided and found that the grill underneath the cover was still dry, even though it had poured for a couple of hours. VERY nice.There is a zipper pocket near the top of the cover. I haven't yet figured what to keep in it, but it is nice to have just in case. My favorite, however, is the handles it has on either end of the top. They make it easy to get a good grip on the cover when you pull it off of your grill.I am extremely pleased with this cover and would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their grill outdoors.

        "reviewText": "My first grill cover for my new Weber grill was from Sears. It lasted about 6 months way down south here in our blazing heat. Moving on from that experience, I thought I'd try a genuine Weber cover for my Weber grill. It was pretty expensive but seemed heavier duty than the Sears. After 18 months it had simply shrunk down too much to get it on or off the grill without having to stretch it. Also, it became very stiff and even brittle. Sure enough, soon it ripped.Having learned that big brand names don't mean much when it comes to grill covers, I came across this Ravenna cover. It is very heavy for a cover. I think that's because it's made of cloth instead of plastic.It fits in an unusual way. When you check among the 3 available sizes you can see that they all have the same height. Mine actually touches the ground all around the grill. It has locking straps that can be looped around the rollers to keep the cover down in the event of some calamity that will likely blow away my home before this cover breaks loose from the grill. As if that is not \"fastened\" enough, you can also pull the cords at the bottom to cinch it up even further like an upside-down tobacco pouch.That fastening system is too much bother for me. The weight and length of this cover keeps it down just fine. I'm sure some folks will love fastening theirs down but some will be like me and not want to bother with it. Just a matter of opinion on that and I'm not scoring the cover down for this.I have one complaint. My cover looks like it was stitched together by someone whose machine either was jamming or who was careless in keeping the spool and bobbin full. Some seams stop in mid track and in other places seams have stitched over long dangly loops of thread. It really looks poor. I question what the use of being able to securely fasten the cover down with straps and cords when it looks like a strong tug will pull some of these seams apart.I went to a school where I had to take a sewing class. If this cover were my assignment there, I'd not have gotten a passing grade on it. In fact, I'm sure I would have gotten a lecture from the teacher on being so careless in my work.Having said that, I'll keep the cover but must knock it down from 5 stars to 3. It seems to be very heavy duty cover but I'm disappointed that mine is stitched together so poorly. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The Ravenna grill cover is a high quality grill cover that appears to be ready to weather the elements over the long haul.  I installed the medium size version of this cover on my Weber Silver B grill.  In the past I've always used the Weber 7573 premium covers and those have served me well.The Ravenna cover is a clear step up in quality and materials versus the Weber cover.  For starters, the Ravenna cover has a much heavier feel.  On the outside it has a heavy-vinyl like feel, similar to the Weber premium cover.  On the inside, the Ravenna cover has an entirely separate heavy-plastic layer that the Weber cover doesn't have.There are a number of vents to allow wind to pass through without lifting the cover off the grill.  In each case, the vents are constructed so that rain would actually have to blow upwards in order to get under the cover.  The Ravenna grill cover also has a simple and easy-to-use strapping system along the bottom that allows you to cinch it around the bottom of your grill stand so that no amount of wind can blow it away.The Weber premium cover typically lasts me about 24 months of outdoor use in the brutal Texas sun before I have to replace.  Only time will tell how the Ravenna grill cover will fare, but given the construction quality, I expect at least that length of time before it needs replacing.One minor complaint: the medium sized cover is about two inches too tall for my Weber Silver B.  This means the bottom of the cover is on the ground.  Once you cinch it up, you don't notice this, but it does mean you have to remove the cover before you can push the grill (I move my grill away from the house before I use it).  Other than the height, this cover is a good fit on the Weber Silver B (which is about the same size as the Weber Spirit 200/300 grills). TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I've learned the hard/expensive way that outdoor furniture covers are very much one of those \"you get what you pay for\" investments.  As I watched an inexpensive one fly away in our first serious windstorm one year, I realized that better ones have a way to fasten them securely onto the furniture.  Wrestling a giant tarp over my wicker love seat and coffee table one year made me long for handles and shaping of some kind.  Fabric needs to be sturdy and resistant to rain, sun, snow, and ice in my climate.The Ravenna cover meets all, and exceeds many, of, these requirements.  The fabric is a heavyweight, stitched, weatherized canvas that is warranted for four years.  The covers have handles (humorously, the instructions for use include, \"If your cover has handles, use them to help pull the cover over your item\" as if we might not think of that).  The fasteners include adjustable click-close straps that fasten around the furniture legs and stretch cording with toggles to pull it snug.  The covers are also vented to prevent captured air from lofting them skyward.I have a set of really heavy, wood and wrought iron chairs on my porch.  Last year, I loaned one to my mother and ended up leaving the rest out all winter to avoid lugging them to my garage, reasoning that the porch roof would protect them.  When I got back the one my mom had, which she had covered for the winter, the comparison made me realize what a disservice I'd done to my chairs.  These good-looking Ravenna covers will let me leave them on the porch without their being an eyesore, and also prevent my having to repaint them again. TL;DR:",

I was expecting the typical reinforced vinyl material that usually lasts two seasons max.  These Classic Accessories covers are constructed of a double stitched, woven polyester material like travel and duffle bags are made of plus they have a waterproof backing.  My first comment was, \"These are too nice to leave outside on the deck all winter.\"Climate extremes are drastic from the scorching desert Southwest to the mildewing tropics of the Southeast which might be more harsh on the fabric than the winters in the upper Midwest.  Some regions might get longer service life than others thus 3-stars in one region and 5-stars in another.Some reviewers say their glass is half empty while others say it is half full.I've rated many items 1-Star.  When I do, I explain why in detail and how I believe it could be made better.  Quite often, I offer, IMHO, a better alternative.For the most part, the 4-Year Replacement Warranty on the Ravenna line speaks for itself.  Unless a family of raccoons finds a new home, I suspect they will last that long or longer.In addition to durability, quality amenities like easy to use buckles and tie-down straps provide a finished, tailored and stylish appearance.If you have quality outdoor furniture with no place to store it during the winter months, here's your answer.Here we go.There are more durable options that will last longer. I have several Military Specification, industrial grade, 22 oz. treated canvas tarps that have lasted over a dozen years.  They are bulky and hard to fold. For 4 months out of the year, the general appearance is that an army of Hobbits have set up an encampment on my deck while the NSA satellite monitors believe that I'm hiding something lethal.Well, I guess a couple of large BBQ grills could be deadly, especially the way I cook.The problem with this option is that whatever you have covered in these tarps will smell like an Army tent for a month after the covers are removed.

It has two straps which buckle around two legs of the pit on opposing sides.  It also has two elastic hem cords, which allow you to tighten the cover to fit snugly around the underside of your firebowl.  You can wrap the two opposing hem cords around a leg each (I think some of the manufacturer ads even show this), so you can secure the cover to all four legs.  While I do not think it is going anywhere, I would have preferred four buckles so that all four sides by the firepit legs could be secured.  I realize not all firepits are the same size and may have different leg configurations, so maybe that was not practical from a design standpoint.There are also handles on either side of the cover so you can lift the firepit and move it.  The material handles are heavy duty and double-stiched in so they shouldn't be an issue.For anyone who likes to keep some wood in your firepit, or just avoid rain washing ashes all over your patio, etc. this is a great cover.It adjusts easily, fits my firepit perfectly and is a nice solution.

Drawstring closures on both sides let you adjust the fit for your pit and keep the cover from blowing off. It also has clasps that you can put around the legs of your pit to hold the cover in place. Handles on top of the cover make it easy to lift the cover off.We've had some good thunderstorms since I got this cover and the pit has stayed dry through all of them.I'm very happy with this cover and with the Classic Accessories brand in general. I will look at their product line again should I have need for something else they make in the future. TL;DR:",

The fire pit was pretty, and we liked the weight of the fire pit, which was heavier than our previous fire pit, which tended to blow around in moderate winds.  However, we were unhappy with the cover that came with the fire pit, which was lightweight plastic with multiple seams that permitted water to leak into the fire pit bowl.  We knew we had to replace the cheap cover with something much more substantial, and the small Ravenna round fire pit cover, which is intended for fire pits up to 44 inches in diameter, appeared to be perfect.When we received the fire pit cover, I was a little concerned about whether the cover was large enough for our fire pit, and I wondered how it attached to our fire pit.  I was needlessly concerned.  The cover has hem cords or straps that tighten the fire pit cover periphery to make it fit snugly onto a fire pit, along with two straps that we used to attach the fire pit cover onto the legs of our fire pit.  Attaching the cover to our fire pit was a matter of two or three minutes of effort to achieve a secure fit.  We quickly learned that the small fire pit cover is intended to cover only the fire pit bowl and the fire pit legs remain slightly uncovered.  Since the legs on our fire pit appear to have a heavy coat of paint, exposure of the legs was fine.  Plus, the exposed legs seem, to us, to be attractive.We are very pleased that the taupe color of the fire pit matches our deck and items on our deck nicely (yes, our deck is wood, but we have bricks that protect our deck from the fire pit).  While black does match most things on our deck, the taupe is an even better match.Does the fire pit cover keep water out of the fire pit bowl?  Yes, it does.  Indeed, the cover has a lining that appears to be water-resistant.  The material of the cover seems to be a heavy canvas-like material that seems as though it would be quite durable, which it must be because the manufacturer offers a four year replacement warranty for the fire pit cover.We needed a fire pit cover to replace the cheap piece of plastic provided by the fire pit manufacturer.  We held our expectations for the Ravenna fire pit cover low, but were extremely pleased with the quality, functionality, and style of the small round Ravenna fire pit cover.  If you are looking for a small round fire pit cover, this one seems to have all the features you would need.Enjoy! TL;DR:",

The hail, which started when we were outside, was somewhere between pea-sized and slightly larger. It was large enough to be painful and left some welts. But the chaise cover came through just fine. I can't say that about others we've had - this is our third so far, all from different manufacturers. None lasted more than a season.I'll update this review after we have a season of severe weather, snow, ice, etc. But based on results so far, I'm very hopeful this will do well.There are some features I especially like about this cover:It is easy to use and can fit a range of chaise lengths. Ours is shorter than the suggested maximum of 66\" and at first we thought the cover would be too baggy. But the hem cord is adjustable, easily allowing us to get a snug fit. Also there are click and snap belts for each leg. No trouble getting those in place. The ideal chaise for this cover would probably be a bit longer. But even on our smaller chaise, this works fine.All in all, it took less than 5 minutes to get this set in place and then adjusted on our chaise and some of that was time removing the cover from the box and packaging. The fabric is nice and thick and, as noted above, didn't rip or tear during a hailstorm, one in which even a couple of roof shingles fell off (and yes, we maintain our roof). In short, this isn't some thin plastic like the type you'd find on inferior covers. It is meant to protect outdoor furniture -and so far it does that very, very well.Since the hailstorm, there have also been quite a few of those sudden and intense summer storms, complete with high winds and drenching rain. Any stains or residue from sticks, dirt, or leaves which fell on the chaise cover were easily wiped up.The padded handles are a very nice touch, making the cover easy to grip and move, both while on the chaise and when getting ready to store it.

I have the Strathwood Rhodes Chaise Lounge Chair and the cover fits perfectly.  It fits (fairly snuggly) with the cushions still on the chair, but I'm afraid that critters would decide it makes a good place to hunker down over the long Minnesota winter.  When I take the cushions off, the cover reaches further down the legs of my chaise.

They work fairly well. They keep the furniture dry and protected and can be easily secured to the legs with click latches that keep them blowing off in storms. I will note that though the item pictured is black, all of our covers, including the one received from ordering via this page, are actually tan. So, just be aware.These seem fairly well-made, sturdy and have handles to take on and off more easily. My only gripe is that they're not indestructible which, of course, is probably hoping for too much. We've noted that 3 years is about their max life span, with cracks or tears occurring after that even with careful care. I think it's just exposure to the weather (where we live it gets very hot) and is basically inevitable. I blame the sun as much as the winter weather, because those covers that are left mostly on during the summer months, for outdoor furniture not used as often that is totally exposed, the life expectancy of the covers is about a season. Those under a little more protection, where the cover is mostly used only during winter months, have lasted up to three years. Your mileage may vary, but that's been our experience.Still, despite the somewhat limited life, I haven't found better covers than the Classic brand in this price range. TL;DR:",

It sits out on our patio and is too big to put in the shed for the winter. We just repainted it and thought this cover would be perfect to protect it. The cover fits on very nicely and with the click-close straps it tightens up enough that it seems as if it will be protected in the winter and not blow off, yet it is loose enough that the bench is still available to put things on if we are bringing them in the back of the house.The construction is very good, with wide seams and sturdy closings. The fabric itself is strong, but yet soft enough that it will not become stiff. I can say this because we have another cover made by this company that we have used for 3 years on our chaise lounge. That cover is still in good shape. It has lasted through blizzards and ice storms, up on a deck where it is more exposed to the winds and weather.So I expect the same reliability out of this cover, since it seems to be made in the same durable manner.

This one has elastic to fit the bottom around the chair, with pull strings to tighten it down. It also has clips and straps to secure it to the chair. In comparison, the big box competitor version had cheap flimsy ties that broke quickly, and so loose they flapped around. In contrast, this one is great!This fits on my swivel wicker chair with a pile of cushions and pillows stuffed underneath for protection. It is made of a sturdy canvas that is contoured to fit the chair. It's waterproof with moisture beading up and rolling off.The best part of this cover is that it can be fitted so well that the cover does not blow off in the wind or flap around. The straps and elastic bands make it possible to fit it to several different chair shapes in the same size range. It also has a convenient handle on the front for lifting it up to remove it.The color is described as taupe. It's fairly dark, a brownish/olive color. Yeah, I guess that would be taupe.

There are four custom-colored buckles that you can tighten to keep the cover secure during any weather and make it easy to put on or take off. I really like the structured air vents that should prevent a good wind from coming along and lifting under the cover during winter storms. It should also let the cover \"breathe\" so mold or mildew doesn't form during our rainy winters here in California.  Also much appreciated are the sturdy padded handles that are a big help when putting the cover on or removing it. (Or just carrying it around.)I ordered this cover to use on a chair which is water and weather proof and can stay out all year, but the chair is white and  we have a lot of small oak leaves and other blowing debris that seem to come down all year, even during the winter. They tend to leave stains that are hard to remove without a lot of elbow grease, especially on white furniture, if they sit on it for any length of time when the weather is wet. Having the chair covered will mean much less clean-up come spring.This cover comes with a 4 year warranty and it certainly looks and feels sturdy enough that it should last long beyond that amount of time.

        "reviewText": "Very nice chair cover.  Really.  We like it a lot.  From the Dad perspective, it's a solid canvas cover that goes over the chair, and that's all that's needed.  But more importantly, Queen Bee likes it a lot, and that is your target demographic, Classic Accessories.  The only real problem I see is that at close to $50 a pop, while we can afford to put one of these on the other three Adirondacks on the deck to match--and this is very important with the target demographic--the need to get another four each in two separate styles and the matching table cover, and then the matching grill cover is going to be pretty spendy, mighty close to prohibitively spendy.  Nice, sure, but looking at more than $500 for this lovely matching transition has even the Queen Bee admitting it's a bit much.We like the color.  The original canvas covers, which it just so happens are now falling apart, are the traditional oatmeal/sand color, which is nice enough new, but after a summer or two outdoors turns an unattractive bleached-out kinda-white.  And, we notice that the lighter color really highlights the green mold growing on all of the covers.  So, this darker color--the highly evocative and official \"dark taupe/mushroom/espresso\"--is so far a winner.  Time will tell how the inevitable weathering will work for this product.The weatherproofing is good, and it's shed water perfectly for the past month.  The fit over the chair has not led to any pooling, which is always a plus.It's got a handle in the front and back, and a vent in the back, but the old cover has the same.  I'm not seeing anything special about these essentially standard features.  This cover has a dash of color variation in the 1\" nylon webbing of the handle.  The product copy says \"webbed handles with extra padding,\" but I'm not seeing the padding.  Nylon webbing makes up the two handles, and there is a tiny bit of softness behind the handle which may legally qualify as padding, but touting it as \"extra padding\" is disingenuous at best.  But then again, who needs padding to use a nylon web handle on a chair cover?  Honestly.The \"structured vent\" is not bad; some tightened-up sewing and a couple of creases do keep it slightly open.  But the vent's mesh screen, while sounding impressive, is utterly superfluous, given that the entire bottom of the cover is completely open.This is a heavy-duty cover, and just putting it over the chair is an undertaking.  The wife likes the elastic drawstring around the bottom.  That's a good addition to keep it all snug over the chair.And to really make sure it doesn't go anywhere you've got the little buckled straps that go around the legs, the \"belted channel attachment system,\" to keep it that much more secure.  This is a nice touch, sure, but it seems overkill.  If the wind is strong enough to lift this roughly four-pound cover off a full-size Adirondack chair, we've got a lot more to worry about than the covers staying on the chairs.  This observation aside, the Queen really loves this little feature; it's another little doo-dad to engage as part of the cover-the-stuff-on-the-deck ritual.Bottom line: this is very nice product outdoor-chair-covering technology.  We've got no complaints about any aspect of it.  But to get everything under the same covers is going to be an expensive endeavor.  This is a hit with the primary domestic team leader, so as other covers wear out, this cover has set a successful precedent for a likely wave of Classic Accessories replacements, the cost be damned!

Since it runs in direct sunshine it works nicely in my pond on hot summer days when I love giving my fish extra oxygen in the water (warm water holds less oxygen stressing the fish).It floats on top of the water and the amount of water that shoots up is based on the amount of sunshine, but it works nicely even in partial shade in my open back yard. Interestingly, at times (with less than full sunlight) it spits the water up every couple of seconds making an interesting and fun effect.I found that the open top worked best in my pond since I was looking for something a bit \"bigger\" than a birdbath size. I wanted \"aeration\" as well as a nice look.I am particularly grateful (as are my goldfish) that VicTsing offered a complimentary sample of the fountain pump so that I could test it and write a review of my experiences.

She has a ton of birds she feeds with various bird feeders, and a large concrete birdbath placed right in the center of them all. After trying out the different included nozzles, we found the bubbler one to be the best, since the other ones worked so well, they would shoot the water out of the birdbath! Those nozzles are perfect for ponds, since they are larger than the typical birdbath.The birds enjoys the activity of the bubbling water, and since it's solar powered, there's no messing with running lines anywhere. It's so simple to set up, more so than we expected. It does need bright direct sunlight to work. It doesn't bank sunlight power for later, like some solar walkway lights do. This just works during the day when the sun is out and bright. As soon as the sunlight isn't beating down on it, the amount of water it shoots goes way down, to little more than a tiny trickle.This is a GREAT little fountain since it's just so simple to use and set up and works so well. It's self contained. It works when the sun is the most intense, which the birds appreciate. Great for birdbaths and ponds, and extremely affordable.

        "reviewText": "This product offers the ability to add aeration (as well as visual interest) to a birdbath without having to deal with any wires or extension cords. It's a pretty simple product - the base is a solar panel which powers a small pump underneath. It comes with a variety of spout attachments to vary the water spray pattern.However, the product design is not well-suited for birdbaths. The pump needs to be fully-submerged in water, which means the birdbath has to be at least 2 inches deep. The suction cups on the base of the pump are pretty weak and will not hold it in place. So, if the basin is shallow at the edges, the platform will float to areas where the pump will not work well. Plus, the pump should remain submerged at all times since pulling in air puts a strain on any water pump.It's much better suited for a pond where it can float freely and keep the pump fully-submerged at all times.Although the pump is pretty small, it does put out a surprising amount of spray. There are four spray patterns to select from. In full sunlight the spray height was easily a foot+ high. That's a bit too much for a birdbath, but nice for a pond. I ended up removing the spray attachments (they are plastic and just push on - no tools needed) so the water just \"burbles\" up from the center. That provides me with the aeration effect I was looking for. Not as pretty as a spray, but more effective for a birdbath.The build quality appears decent for the price. However, given the all-plastic construction, this is not something you'd want to leave outdoors in the winter.The solar panel provides ample power in full sunlight, and workable power in partial sun/overcast conditions (by \"workable\" I mean the spray works, but the height is diminished, and it occasionally will cut off for a few seconds). There is no battery, so if there's no sun, there's no spray.I can't speak to the longevity of the pump, but will update the review should there be a problem. It operates quietly, which is nice.It comes with a brief instruction sheet that is not well written, but the operation of the device is pretty straightforward so that you can figure it out just by looking at the pieces and parts (which are just the spray attachments and connectors).This is a great choice for a pond, and may be a workable choice for a birdbath depending on the depth. I'll give it 4.5 stars (rounded to 5 since it looks pretty!).[Sample provided for review] TL;DR:",

TheVicTsing 1.4 W Floating Solar Fountain Pumpis an outstanding solution, featuring solar power and easy to put together parts.This unit is just over 6.5\" in diameter and goes together quickly. This fountain features 3 (three) different heads to give you variety and options, finding the spray that best meets your tastes and wishes.I took the unit outside to get it setup and it turned on immediately.  I turned it away from the sun until I got to the pond.  I slid the fountain into the pond and it began functioning nicely.  I tested each of the three (3) heads to find the one I liked best; of the different heads, the height varied around 1' up to 1' 6\".  Speed and power was varied on sunlight and the particular head I selected.  Being solar dependent, the unit will drop pressure and eventually turn off in shade; it has no battery inside, but then you won't have to change batteries, so that's a good thing.There are so many great uses for theVicTsing 1.4 W Floating Solar Fountain Pump.

Very inexpensive and has been working well for about  three weeks. We thoroughly enjoy watching it. When the sun is out. It is extremely sensitive to lack of sunshine ~ even on days where there are a few clouds in the sky ~ if the sun goes away, so does the fountain! I love that it came with several different fountain sprays. My favorite, is actually the shorter, standard type fountain fixture.I've not had trouble with the water being expelled from the bird bath as others have. Even when using the taller fountain fixtures. I love that it keeps the birdbath water circulating ~ keeps it cleaner for a lot longer! Mosquitoes aren't quite here yet, but this should help keep them at bay.This particular pump has little rubber suctions cups that should stick to a bird bath that is GLAZED (maybe painted). My birdbath is concrete and it doesn't stick (I didn't expect it to). However, it sits nicely right in the center and doesn't move. The birdbath needs to be kept filled up so that the pump is submerged at all times or you'll risk burning it out.You need to keep that solar panel up high, facing as much of the sun as possible. I'm fortunate enough to have a 6' PVC fence and perch that panel up leaning on one of the fence post caps and it's perfect! The birds were a bit afraid of it at first, but not they really love it and I actually get birds bathing instead of just drinking, which is a treat for us:)For the price, I think anyone would enjoy this cute little fountain; just don't expect it to work well, or at all, without sunshine!

The blades are European steel and continue in one solid piece down the handles, so there are no joints/connections to break.  I have actually broken the handle off cheap loppers.  The steel handles are covered with high-quality aluminum handles, with cork grips at the end.  I was curious about the inclusion of the cork but I suppose it is light and will improve grip, and cork will actually expand a bit when wet to give even better grip.  I do wonder what the cork will be like if it gets chipped years down the road, but the loppers should still mechanically work fine regardless.So how well do they work?  The effort required to cut up to 2\" branches is impressively minimal.  I could almost say it's like cutting butter.  To open the blades fully and get the full ~2\" cut the handles open almost perpendicular, 4.5 feet wide at the tips.  This allows you to take full advantage of leverage and the gearing.  But opening that wide can also be a disadvantage if space is tight, like when I was cutting dead branches off the trunk of a spruce tree with other nearby prickly branches and needles.Even though they are not heavy for their size they are fairly long, so using them can be a bit of a workout.  If you do a lot of cutting your arms may feel it if you're not in shape.  The actual cutting is surprisingly easy, but just wielding them can be tiring.Overall I'd highly recommend these loppers, they are well-made, strong, and cut with ease.  They should last a lifetime.

This does not count an untold number of these things that have been loaned to relatives and friends never to be seen again....good grief, I am a push-over.We have several acres of land which include woods, an orchard, flower beds, rose garden and numerous shrubs and trees.  When I received these loppers by Fiskars I immediately put them to work.  As of this writing they have over 28 hours on the.  Trimming, cutting and cleaning is a year around deal at our place and for ever limb or plant that needs trimmed, a dozed more seem to appear over night.So far I have tried these loppers on apple, peach, pear, cherry, oak, hickory, mulberry, locust, wild cherry, Osage orange, large back berry brambles, grape vines and an plethora of trees that I simply do not know the name of.  This lopper has not failed me one time.It does indeed, as advertized, handle limbs up to two inches in diameter.  Hate to use the term, but these loppers go through everything like cutting through soft butter.  They make a very clean cut; a decisive cut and it takes very little effort to do this cutting.  For me the handles are just the right length to give maximum leverage and the cord grips are great.  They actually work even better (the grips) when they become a bit moist with sweat.Two thing to remember about this tool.  First, it works best when the biting end is opened to the widest point...do not try to nip a limb with just the end of the cutting surface.  Second, do remember that the business end of this is steel and even though it is touted at rust resistant...it will never the less rust eventually if not cleaned properly or left out in the elements.  After every use I make sure mine or cleaned and I apply a very, very thin film of three in one oil.  I have done this with all my yard tools over the years and I have some clippers and loppers that have been in constant use since the 1940s and are still going strong.This lopper may seem a bit high ended but if taken care of it will last you a life time and will quire likely be the only lopper you will ever have to buy.Impressive product.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks TL;DR:",

This new line of professional loppers is Scandinavian-made, so the metal quality and workmanship is a step above the usual \"made in China\" tools you'll find at the local hardware store.This lopper has very long handles which makes them a little tough to ease into the interior of rosebushes, for example, but gives you much more leverage when pruning thicker tree branches. The handle length is something to consider when choosing a lopper - short handles get into smaller shrubs easier but require more power to work. This lopper cuts inch-thick woody branches with absolute ease, and because it is bypass-style, it makes a very clean cut that is unlikely to develop disease issues.This lopper is comparable in weight, for its size, to the PowerGear loppers from Fiskars, which is to say it is heavier because it is longer, but not much heavier. And I love that this high-end lopper has a similar gearing system to the regular Fiskars PowerGear loppers we use as standard in my landscaping business.If I were cutting hard, crusty dead wood, I'd probably choose the Garret Wade Pro Ratcheting lopper over this, just because it has a ratchet feature which makes it possible to cut thicker, harder branches easily (and it has extending handles, which is nice), but you pay for that gfeature set on the Garrett Wade ones with added weight. These Fiskars ones are the nicest everyday pruning lopper I have seen. They far beat out my standard coronas which were about seventy dollars, and are obviously a cut above the regular PowerGear line from Fiskars in both longevity and cutting ability (they seem to cut with slightly more ease and have a coating to keep the blade from gumming up.The cork acts as a bumper to keep wrists from getting strained and reduce that jarring sensation after each cut. It's surprisingly effective.Overall, a fantastic everyday lopper that is worth the extra money. TL;DR:",

The largest diameter I can go up to with my current loppers is about 1.5 inches and that's a struggle. With the Fiskars I'm able to get through those branches with about 1/2 the effort. Of course the blade is brand new so that helps but the geared blades really give excellent leverage on the cut. The padded handles are a plus and the whole tool feels very solid and high quality.

I effortlessly sliced through a fairly thick oak limb today and used them to tame some Philodendrons Gone Wild in the front yard.  I then used them to break up some cabbage palm fronds and to slice out a root that was keeping me from digging a fence post hole.There is extra leverage in the long handles.  Couple that leverage with a gearing mechanism and you will no longer have to jar your shoulder trying to cut through a 2\" branch.  I'm very impressed with these although there are two points that I believe need improvement.  First, my loppers don't stay closed - they are fairly loose and want to open when I'm carrying them.  My other cheaper Fiskars loppers are much more tight.  Second, I worry about the longevity of the cork.  Aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to grip...but durable?  Time will tell.  Finally, the price point is a bit steep which means you'll have to really need good loppers if you plan to buy these.Overall, I'm impressed by these and using them is actually a bit of fun.

The trees are older than 20 years and include multiples of birch, hackberry, Italian cypress, mock orange, crape myrtle, weeping bottlebrush, Callery pear, xylosma, pine, oak, redwood, and last, but not least, manzanita. I have cared for these trees with another heavy-duty lopper with varying degrees of success, so I wanted to try another tool.Because of the price, my initial thought was that these were going to lose a star for that alone.  Then I used them.  Many of the tree types in my yard can be cut fairly easily; however, the pine, oak, redwood and manzanita are extremely hard, especially in thicker branches.  These loppers went through the pine, oak, and redwood branches like a hot knife through butter.  Obviously, loppers have limits because at some point, i.e., thickness, you have to resort to a pruning saw, but when these went through one-inch plus diameter manzanita branches without too much effort, they had me.  Supposedly the loppers will handle up to two inches, so this review will be updated as I try to prune larger branches as well as the item's general wear.Generally in handling the loppers, I especially like the light weight and the shape of the handles being more flattened versus fully round.  If I were to suggest one improvement, it would be to have the handles be telescoping as my older lopper is because I am only 5'3\" tall.  Here is the rest of the story:  I'm 66 and have fibromyalgia.  Using these loppers nonstop for three hours was not anywhere near as difficult or jarring as it was with my old loppers.  As for the cost, they will pay for themselves versus hiring gardening services.Regarding the lifetime warranty, I already know that Fiskars stands behind its products.  I have the Fiskars 9240 Telescoping Pruning Stik, purchased in 2006, and had to contact Fiskars for repairs in 2011.  Customer service is exceptional.  Regarding maintenance, Fiskars recommends that if you do not feel comfortable sharpening your own tools, ask your local gardening center to recommend a professional sharpening service, or call Fiskars' warranty service line at 1-800-500-4849 for more information. Fiskars does not provide sharpening service.

        "reviewText": "Effortlessly cuts - a truly superior tool. I own, or have owned a number of branch loppers because my yard is filled with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Elm tree runners. The runners grow so fast that it seems like within a few weeks the trunks are an inch in diameter. Let a couple of months pass by and a lopper like this is a necessity.The first lopper I bought over ten years ago was a Fiskars brand. It is smaller model, and I needed something larger because of the seemingly endless job of cutting off large runners, and the desire to clip them off as close to the ground as possible - something difficult to accomplish with a saw. I purchased that bigger lopper in a big box do-it-yourself store. I was unfamiliar with the brand. That should have been a red flag because the tool was so difficult to operate, required great strength to close the blades, cutting was quickly exhausting. Being that tough to use rendered it essentially worthless, so I donated it to charity.After that disappointing purchase I returned to the brand that had worked so well for me in the past, so three years ago bought a twenty-six inch ultra-blade Fiskars lopper with the same power head design as the model used for this review. I always associated quality with this brand, and although I was happy with the surprisingly inexpensive price tag, after briefly working with the twenty-six inch lopper, it was clear that along with the dropping price, the quality had also noticeably declined. While a great improvement over the lopper that didn't work at all, it wasn't nearly as smooth to operate and didn't seem to stay sharp as long as my older Fiskars.So, I viewed this latest lopper with some suspicion but when it arrived it was obvious that it was of better quality than my last Fiskars model. I compared them side-by-side and although the mechanism is similar, the quality of the materials and workmanship is different. On this model the steel is more refined, less coarse, the edges on the head are finely finished, the bolts are of higher quality, the handle much more comfortable to grip, and it operates smoothly and so far the blades haven't dulled as quickly.My last Fiskars lopper, model which cost just under $30, was made in China, and this much more expensive version is made in Finland. It appears the old quality has returned. And although there is a market for both products, the reality is that finding inexpensive, lower quality items of all sorts isn't difficult, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find quality made items. This is welcome news because it is always good to have options. And, if interested, read a discussion about quality differences in production locations in the Fiskars scissors reviews on this site after all production for that product line was moved out of Finland.I've been working with the lopper for the last few weeks, and since I ignored the Elm tree runners for far too long, there was much to cut. It was a big job, but this new model cut through everything smoothly and effortlessly. As far as quality, it puts my last Fiskars lopper to shame. I don't like wasting money, and if this was a tool I just used occasionally perhaps the quality difference wouldn't be so noticeable, and the price difference hard to justify. But with tools that get a work-out, I find it is best not to scrimp. TL;DR:",

TheirFiskars 7936 PowerGear Prunerhas served me well for several years, and last year, I picked up theFiskars 9668 Long Handle Digging ShovelandFiskars 9654 Transplanting Spadeabout a year ago, and they have proven to be indestructible.I also have theFiskars 9154 PowerGear 32-Inch Bypass Lopper, which is the plain-looking sibling to this Quantum Hand Lopper. Having both, it's easy to make comparisons between the two and to provide some insight as to whether the large difference in price is worthwhile for you.As with its hand-pruner cousin, this cork-handled silver lopper is a beauty to look at. Unfortunately, that seems to be the only differentiating factors when it comes to using it. The description says that it's made from \"premium European steel,\" but I'm not sure how much of a benefit that really is. While using it for a couple of hours clearing fallen branches from a wooded path, it worked the same as the black-handled lopper I've had for a few years (which is a testament to that model's durability).The cork handles have the potential of being easier on the hands, but they also have the potential of flaking off from use/damage. I wear work gloves when doing landscape work, so I prefer the rubberized handles of the 9154. The cheaper model also has more bright orange (the entire handles), which means that it is easier to find in the brush.The 9482 also shares the one limitation that I would like to see changed on the 9154. Recently, I managed to pinch my thumb pretty badly while trying to use it in close quarters. Some sort of guard or ring near the top of the handles to help you be aware of your hand placement might have prevented me from my act of stupidity. Is that a fault of the loppers? Not at all, but it is something that would improve already-fine products.As a result, I judge both models to be equivalent in all the ways that really matter. At almost 3x the list price of the 9154, it's hard to justify why someone would want to purchase this model. If the silver color and the cork handles appeal to you and you are willing/able to pay the price, by all means, go for it! You'll get a great hand tool that will probably last a very long time. Its lifetime warranty will be there if it does break or wear out, so you're covered either way! TL;DR:",

Generally I find that if I can get something in the Felco's jaw, I can cut it and don't need extra leverage, though I could see the gears being useful if you were lacking arm strength.While the Fiskars blades are coated to reduce buildup, they are not replaceable, unlike the Felco. Furthermore, the shape of the Fiskars opening and the shorter blade length means that precise nips are harder and larger branches may be difficult to get fully in the jaw. I also wonder about sharpening the Fiskars blades as there were no instructions included. I did find some generic sharpening instructions on the Fiskars web site.While the cork on the handle grips seems like a nice idea, it is likely to get torn up and coated with sap with any kind of serious use.

I may have earned a D in physics back in the day, but I know what works - like this pair of loppers and my long handles Fiskars ax. Both are marvelous.The head of the Fiskars lopper is encased in a clear plastic cover that I removed using the pictogram instructions. These pictograms are often used in Fiskars products to convey directions. The hard plastic cover may be kept on the loppers during storage, but judging from my past history, I'm likely to lose it.Owning four pairs of loppers presently, including a smaller pair of Fiskars, and having owned countless pairs previously, I'm not new to loppers and the lavish promises made by promoters. My former favorite Corona loppers are supposed to have 3x power; they perform well though I've never been convinced of their super power.These long-handled Fiskars are the real deal. I used these loppers for several hours to test them out, cutting live and dead branches both. With each cut I was amazed and awed. No other lopper I've ever used comes close to the smoothness and power of these loppers. They are comfortable to use and don't require the back straining effort of other loppers, even on those 2 inch plus cuts. Even cutting branches above my head that required full arm extension was a breeze. I never would have considered paying this much for a pair of loppers, but having used the Fiskars 9482 32-Inch Quantum Hand Lopper, Id have to say they are worth every penny.The power gear mechanism of these loppers works smoothly, unlike the clumsy ratcheting systems I've experienced with other loppers. This patented gearing mechanism \"makes cutting effortless.\" Yes, it really does.The blade has a polymer coating for corrosion resistance, the cork handle is light and supportive, and the aluminum alloy used in the loppers' construction is strong yet light. A full lifetime warranty backing the product is a nice bonus.If you go to the Fiskars site, there's precious little about how to maintain these loppers or buying a replacement blade in the future. It's best to clean the blade with rubbing alcohol after each use to maintain the lopper blade and prevent spreading disease.

Cutting thick branches with those loppers feels more like slicing through wet sugar cane or 1/2 inch thick branches than through 1.5 inches of solid wood. With those loppers, I was able to handle all but the thickest branches that I need to cut during a regular pruning. Thus I was looking forward to its larger cousin, the 9482 32-inch lopper.As much as I like its smaller cousin, this larger one is noticeably different in many ways. Although it's designed for branches that are only 1/2 inch larger in diameter, this pair of loppers is significantly larger and robust. It has much longer and better cushioned handles, and a larger jaw with precise blade alignment. It makes easy work out of everything the smaller pair did, and much more.The first thing I tried with it was to cut through an old branch from my last pruning session. It was too big for the smaller loppers and needed to be cut with a saw. Cutting through an old dead piece of wood like that is akin to cutting through a two inch wooden pole rather than through a live branch. At first I thought that there was no chance of getting the loppers to budge. But with enough force, I was able to cut completely through it with enough control that my son was able to hold the branch loosely as I did so. That's more of a task than I'd expect these to be put through in normal use, and I'm not in the best shape of my life.For regular branches, even those as thick as the jaws will allow, the amount of force needed is surprisingly low. The manufacturer claims that these give up to three times the cutting force of single pivot tools. In reality, they give three times the power of large, top quality single pivot tools with high quality blades. The \"three times\" statement is not a subjective claim, but an accurate one based on the laws of physics. Since work equals force times displacement, by designing the handles to move three times as far for the same amount of jaw movement as traditional loppers, you do the same amount of work with one third the force.There are only two down sides that I can think of for this product. One is that a lot more room is needed to open these up, so there's a potential for them to be unusable in tight spaces. I didn't encounter any real life situations where that happened, and since you are more likely to use these with trees than with tight shrubbery, that might not be a realistic concern.The other is price. I think these are well worth the money for something of this quality and size. But if your primary use is for branches that are 1.5 inches or less, with occasional two inch branches, it might make sense to get the smaller Fiskars and use a saw for those rare occasions.  But if you want something that cuts through those 1.5 inch branches like a knife through butter, you might still want these larger ones. A good strategy might be to get the smaller ones as a second cheaper pair for lighter work. Or you could buy the smaller ones first and then decide if you need the larger ones. But if you are looking specifically for something that cuts branches within this item's range, I would not hesitate to recommend it. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I've been a more of a fan of anvil-type hand pruners rather than the scissors (bypass) type. But these hand pruners have me rethinking that.The problem with scissors/bypass pruners is that the blades tend to move apart over time, and eventually you find you're pinching and folding over woody stems instead of cutting cleanly.I'm confident that won't happen with these shears. They are precision made. You can tell right out of the package that they are top quality. Everything is manufactured to close tolerances, and the materials are high grade. There's no \"slop\" or wiggle in them, just smooth action. I doubt seriously anything is going to get out of alignment, unless someone tries to cut barbed wire with them or something.A few test cuts prove that these are indeed sharp and well aligned shears -- no folding or pinching, just clean, smooth cuts.As for the cork handles, I have a friend who doesn't like to touch unfinished wood. So I asked her to try these out to see how they worked for her. She said they feel more like a rubberized grip than cork, so they are very comfortable for her.Five stars for these pruners. They'll be a favorite of most every gardener and grower. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed about these pruners are the cork handles. The all-natural cork is supposed to be soft and shock-absorbing. I've never considered cork particularly soft, but I will say that it gives the handles a very non-slip feel. I'm concerned that the cork will wear poorly with heavy use, but I'll add an update if I find that to be true.Overall, the pruners appear to be a very high quality. Everything except the locking mechanism (and the cork) is metal. The lock to hold the blades closed is easy to slide into place but not so loose that it might release unexpectedly. The blades are of steel and the top blade has a coating to resist corrosion. The coating doesn't look like it will wear off quickly, either.However, the pruner is a bit large for my hand. I'm an average-sized woman with long-fingered hands, but it's awkward for me to hold these pruners fully open. It was the same for my dad, who is a tall man. I placed these pruners on top of two of my other pruners, and the handles on this one open about 1/2 an inch wider than the others yet they have the same width opening between the blades when fully open. When I hold these pruners comfortably in my hand, I can only cut about 1/2\" or less width branches. From past experiences, I expect anything larger will quickly tire my hand muscles.I tried the pruners out on some 1/4\" apple branches today, and they easily cut through the branches. I'll probably just use these pruners for my smaller-width pruning projects. One nice thing about these pruners is that they can be used left- or right-handed.UPDATE: I've been giving these pruners moderate use in our garden for about 8 months now. The cork handle doesn't appear to be having any wear problems, so I'm no longer concerned about that. I've been using them mainly to harvest beans, bell peppers, tomatoes, and similar vegetables. For this type of resistance and thickness, they work well--very sharp and don't tire my hands within the short use period. TL;DR:",

Perhaps this is something I could learn to prevent through holding it differently, but I'm not sure.Performance aside, this tool's high price creates a situation where it doesn't represent the value that the lower-priced 7936 does.

In my case I use the dry Miracle-Gro and mix a pouch in a very large 50 gallon container.  I then can dispense an equal portion of the mix to each plant knowing that each is getting the same formula.  Now with the Miracle-Gro LiquaFeed - it is attached to a hose and is suppose to mix equal portions of liquid and water.  If this is true then fine, however I have found that when you get to near the end of the liquid supply that you don't know if the last to receive the mix are getting an equal portion.  I always had this problem in the past with the dry mix gadgets that Miracle-Gro had in the past, and that's why I went with mixing in a container first and watering with my watering can.  Well if one wanted to use the LiquaFeed gadget and dry (mixed with water) then I suppose this would work, but then you run into the problem of the last run mix as I described.Now for the minus one star - the cost.  I used Amazon Prime figures and Miracle-Gro's per square feet dispensing numbers.  Miracle-gro 10 lb powder on Amazon prime costs about $19.50 and covers 500 x 8 packs or 4000 square feet.  This equates to $.004875 per square foot.  The Miracle-grow 4 pack Liquafeed refill costs around $11.50 on Amazon Prime and covers 400 x 4 bottles or 1600 square feet.  This equates to $.0071875 per square foot.  So the Liquafeed on Amazon costs approximately 1.5 times more.  If you do a lot of fertilizing this could get very expensive very fast.

        "reviewText": "This is my third Miracle-Gro starter kit.  I've been using this product for so long I can't count the years.  When this one arrived, I compared it to the older two spray nozzles (which still work after a LOT of use):  This is the same as what I bought last year--not a single difference that I can see.  Does the fertilizer do its job?  Oh, my, yes!  And I surely wouldn't be a long-time user and supporter of this Miracle-Gro fertilizer if it didn't give me great results.Plus, it is so easy to use and convenient!  I use the general purpose for all the flowers, green plants and herbs.  Then I switch out the all-purpose bottle with the bottle developed specifically for vegetables for the veggie gardens.  For my very delicate maidenhair ferns and my non-flowering orchids, I screw the spoon attachment onto the (all-purpose) bottle instead of the nozzle and I use a weaker solution in a watering can.  (You squirt fertilizer from the bottle into the attached spoon (it has measurement lines), tip the spoonful into your watering can and go again.)Now, if you have a many-years-old model, there are differences; or if you've never used this product before, here's the scoop:  There are four spray configurations from which to choose; the turn knob at the top (for plain water / off / water-fertilizer mix) is easier to get a grip on and easier to turn; the handle is ergonomically correct, with on / off button easy to manipulate.  The bottle of liquid fertilizer (comes with one bottle) screws into the yellow end, so the nozzle as a whole looks a bit odd, but it is trying to do a balancing act with the bottle of fertilizer.Regarding the four spray choices:  The \"shower\" gives a good, general coverage--not too wide, not too heavy/harsh.  The \"flat\" works very well for me when it is very windy, or when I have plants close together in a line.  The \"stream\" is the configuration with all the tiny holes in the round; it also works for me when it is windy, or when I want to reach plants further away, as it is a more forceful spray.  The other one is \"jet\", and I don't use that much at all, because it really disturbs the soil around the base of the plant and is forceful enough to make a mess of flower petals.  But I suppose the jet spray is good for shooting into a container.If you've not used this product before, you should check on the price of replacement feeder bottles to see if it is in line with your budget:  You do pay for convenience!  If you've got a good-sized garden, you will go through many bottles of this fertilizer if you fertilize as often as the directions recommend.  I fertilize about once every two weeks.  So, once every two weeks, I switch out the nozzle heads on my hose and use this, then I water and fertilize at the same time.  Whalla!  And done!(I have tried to use this nozzle as my everyday nozzle, (because you can turn the knob on top to water only) but I think it is a bit too heavy and cumbersome for constant use.)One tip:  After fertilizing, switch the knob to water only and spray for a short minute to clear the insides of fertilizer solution, in an effort to prevent corrosion.  Happy gardening!This kit comes in a plastic \"stand\", with a hole for one bottle, the spoon and the nozzle.  I think it is a waste of plastic, and I don't think it adds value to the product.

This Miracle-Gro kit is a pretty handy delivery system for metered delivery of the all purpose food through the included hose sprayer attachment.  The included plant food is good for flowers vegetables and other plants, and the bottle screws right into the sprayer unit, which also screws onto the end of your hose, so as you water your plants, you can feed them at the same time.  This is great for gardens/beds larger than watering can size.  For watering can size beds/pots or indoor plants, there is also a measuring spoon included for accurate measuring of the plant food into your can of water.  The sprayer has adjustable spray patterns on the front of the nozzle and a dial on the top for regulating flow. Miracle-Gro also makes plant-specific liquid food bottles that fit this unit, so if you are watering/feeding all vegetables or all flowers, you can get that specific food, once this starter bottle is gone.  I've used products like this before, but it is nice to get a sprayer that has trigger control, flow control and multiple spray patterns.  Not all plants get watered the same way. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The little battery pack did pretty good at giving my cell phone a quick charge to about half power. Enough to make a few calls and last till I could get back home to charge it. The solar panels are a bit slow even on a clear day. They would work ok for when you are out camping and you want to recharge your MP3 player or tablet. If it had another pair of panels to fold out and double the solar collection of power it would really help this a lot. To give it a good test I put a set of 4 rechargeable AA batteries that were dead in it and hung the solar panels in a south facing window. It took a good 2 days to get a usable charge in them and almost 3 full days to get close to a full charge. Now if it was laying out flat on something and got full on sunshine on it I'm sure it would have done a lot better. The best use I can see for this is to take it with you when you go camping or back packing for when you have the time to wait and good cloud free sky and plenty of sunshine along with a couple extra sets of rechargeable batteries to have one set recharge with it while using another set in your radio or MP3 player or what ever.Overall its bit too expensive and too slow to actually be practical for use around the home when you can plug a charger in the wall that's a lot quicker and easier to use. But, for those that live on the Gulf Coast or East Coast and often get hit with storms that can take out the power for several days to weeks at a time then this, or something like this, might be something to consider putting in your emergency supplies. For me, it's going in my camping equipment for when I go to the mountains and camp to fish or hunt for a week or two at a time. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "Note:I received this kit in addition to a second standalone Nomad 7 solar panel, allowing me to daisy-chain them together, effectively doubling the power capacity. My review is mostly based on the use of the this kit WITH the 2nd panel added to it, although I will try to touch on it's function as a standalone kit as well.This is the coolest thing I've added to my backpacking gear list in a long time.Pros:-Comes with a battery charger and 4 NiMH AA batteries, as well as an adapter for AAA's (but it does not come with AAA batteries).-The battery charger has a USB output, so you can use the AA's to charge your USB-chargeable devices. from it. Goal Zero also recommends that you use the battery pack as a &#34;buffer&#34; between the solar panel(s) and your device, to allow your device to receive a consistant charge.-2 panels daisy-chained together provided more than enough power to charge my Samsung Note 3, even without using the battery pack for a &#34;buffer&#34;. Each panel can be expected to provide about 1 amp at 5v under average sunlight, so 2 panels (2 amps) can charge in iPad at the same rate as a standard wall-charger.-Folds up flat, very easy to pack in a backpack. Stays closed using built-in rare earth magnets.-Very well constructed, and looks nice. You can tell the engineers thought of everything!-Each panel includes parachute cord loops on the sides, so you can use carabiners or string to hang it from something, or hang them from each other if you have more than 1.Cons:-It weighs a lot, and is probably not an effective replacement for disposable batteries during short journeys. On my home scale, the panel by itself weighs 17oz without the detachable cables, and the battery charger weighs 2.75oz with the AAA adapter. Add to that to the weight of a second panel, 4 AA's and 4 AAA's, and suddenly your power system now weighs around 3lbs. For a long journey, it is absolutely worth the weight to me, but for a weekend outing, I think I'll stick with just carrying some spare batteries.-The pigtail cable that allows you to daisy-chain multiple panels together is too short in my opinion, and it is permanently installed in the solar panel so it can't be replaced, but you might be able to make a pigtail extension cable for it.Overall impression:Probably not good for short outings, due to the weight. A few spare batteries would weigh significantly less than this charging kit. However, for long outings, this is one of the coolest electronic devices I've seen. It will make sure your GPS, phone, camera, etc. will never run out of juice no matter how long you're gone! TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The sun is a truly awesome power source.  We are 93 million miles away and still, with minor variations, every square meter receives 1,366 watts of solar energy 24 hours a day (trust me - there are an awful lot of square meters facing the sun from that distance).  Well, that's if you are directly facing the sun in outer space.  Depending on clouds, latitude, time of day and time of year, something like half of that amount actually reaches us at ground level.  That's a little less than one electric stove burner per square meter but still pretty awesome.This unit can produce 7 watts in good sunlight - that's about 1 percent of the solar power landing per square meter.  OK the folding solar panel is rather less than one square meter - closer to one square foot.  Sure the power is free when the sun is visible but the technology still has a long way to go to reach its full potential.For the gadget minded, the great thing about this unit is that you don't have to rely on the sun to power your iphone as you can use the unit to charge the include batter charger, which comes with 4 NiMH AA batteries.  Then you can use the USB cable to charge your iphone at your leisure.  So, the manufacturers have hit on what makes unreliable solar power work - you need either backup power or battery storage.  You can also charge directly from the panels, if you're got enough sunlight, but the more reliable way is to charge up the battery pack first.  The battery pack also works as a flashlight.I've seen other reviewers praise this as a great survival device.  Frankly, I'd rather use the weight carrying a decent survival knife like the Bushmaster. A more likely use is for people with truly unreliable electric power - if they have long, long outages, this could at least let them keep in phone contact.A gadget freak might love this as a &#34;free&#34; battery charger (well it's free once you buy the thing as you don't have to pay to plug the thing in).  I could also see it being used in the classroom to show the kiddies the wonders, and I hope the limitations, of solar power. TL;DR:",

I got a couple of full charges on my iPhone, and it slowed down the power draw on my iPad (not good for a full recharge there).For an ordinary travel bag, I wouldn't use this as my main power backup. It's on the slow side for recharging, and the total capacity is limited. But as an emergency bag power supply, it's hard to beat. If you don't have power, your backup power units are useless once drained. Granted, you can't always rely on the sun to be out to charge the Goal Zero, but at least it's a possibility. I can see this being the difference between &#34;life and death&#34; in longer-term disasters if it comes to needing to contact outside help.It's definitely not a cheap option, but in the middle of an emergency, I think it's well worth the price.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "QUICK UPDATE:  We've had a rough winter, and there were some days when my feeders were inaccessible to me.  As a result, this feeder was the only one with seed in it for awhile.  The birds should have been pretty desperate for a meal with all the snow cover and sub-zero temperatures, but they weren't desperate enough to empty this feeder.  I can't account for this, but it's a big strike against the feeder.This is a decent-looking feeder (more attractive than its picture, in my opinion), and the smaller birds like it okay, although it's not their first choice, and for some reason they like it less once the seed level has dropped to where only the lower half is filled.  It can't accommodate larger birds unless they are clingers (most aren't) because the \"fly through\" spaces don't provide roomy enough perching area.  I also don't see an advantage to encouraging small birds to sit in a spot where they soil the feeder and food while they eat.  It's not squirrel-proof by any definition, although it is squirrel-discouraging and slows them down enough that they will turn to another feeder if one is available.What will probably cost this feeder its place in the lineup here is the mess of filling it.  I made the mistake of filling it indoors the first time, yikes!  The seeds stream out nearly as fast as they stream in.  Even filling it outdoors where I don't mind some seed on the ground is too wasteful.  I'm not sure where the line is drawn between seed being easily extracted from the wire openings and seed spilling out, but this feeder errs heavily on the side of spillage.I do think it might work better with shelled peanuts and might appeal to woodpeckers with those, and I may try that at some point.  I have a Brome squirrel-proof peanut feeder now, and the birds' response to it is pretty lackluster (and filling it is a pain), so it will be interesting to see if the Fly-Through feeder is a better choice for peanuts.

        "reviewText": "The Perky-Pet Fly-Through Bird Feeder was very easy to fill.  After putting it out, I had birds all over it but then I already had a very active bird feeding \"post\" with four different feeders.  I don't know if it attracts squirrels or not - my post is not near any trees and has a shield on the bottom to make it squirrel-proof.  The product page suggests that you use sunflower seeds and there is a reason for that - the holes in the feeder are huge and there is no bottom/pan so even the sunflower seeds fall out the bottom.  Consequently, this is probably the \"messiest\" bird feeder that I've owned.  I'd suggest you fill it with larger food like peanuts, but I'm not sure they would work as well.  If I could take it apart, I'd replace the wire mesh bottom with a metal pan in order to at least keep the sunflower seeds from raining out the bottom.Contrary to another Vine Voice reviewer, there ARE NOT pointy pieces of metal all over the feeder.  Not sure if she just got a bad one or she has an axe to grind (or I just got one of the \"good ones\"), but her story about the bird with the damaged wing appears to be anecdotal and/or wishful thinking.  So the feeder seems really neat - its a great idea to have the birdies climbing in and out of the feeder while you watch - but considering how much seed you'll lose, I'm not positive its super functional.

        "reviewText": "This \"fly-through\" bird feeder is highly specialized in that it can only contain sunflower seeds and/or peanuts because the mesh holes are too large for mixes and smaller seeds. The birds that it attracts not only must like those seeds but must be able to cling to the sides since there are no perches.  For the first 24 hours, I didn't see a single bird eat from it even though they were emptying nearby feeders.  By the second day, some were brave enough to try it: titmice, chickadees, and house finches.  Now the birds will occasionally hit this feeder when the others are crowded.  Even though they seem to love sunflower seeds, they don't seem to love the feeder.  Well, all but one bird prefers the others.  When it's rainy, one male house finch goes inside the fly-through part to stay dry. Who would've thunk?The feeder is relatively easy to fill:  you hold in the catch above the roof and slide open the top.  The top doesn't move completely out of the way, so I have to be careful when filling it.  With the open mesh design, a lot of the sunflower seeds fall through as I'm filling it.  I have to scoop up the seeds and funnel them back in with my hands.  The feeder holds 2-3 pounds of seed.  The construction seems sturdy enough, although I'm concerned about other reports of bird injuries so I'm keeping a close eye on it.  I can't figure out how a bird would injure itself on the feeder since they are used to clinging and poking at things, and I don't see any exposed sharp edges.  Still, that doesn't mean it won't happen.The best thing about this feeder is that it actually manages to stay full longer than my other feeders because it attracts fewer birds.  If you have only one feeder in your yard, don't make it this one.  If you want a feeder to hold black oil sunflower seeds and/or peanuts and if you already have at least one other feeder, give this one a try.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann TL;DR:",

The design is unlike any of our other bird feeders, and the requirement of filling it with only large seed (smaller seeds, and even large ones, fall right through) promised to attract a different sub set of birds than we are used to.Filling is easy, as the top has just one button that frees it to slide along the hanger wire. Pouring in the black oil sunflower seeds was straightforward, but I recommend putting it on a flat solid surface to limit the amount of seed that falls out while filling. (There&#8217;s going to be a lot of leakage, anyway, so make sure you fill it outside in the vicinity of where it will be hung.) Once it was up, it was only a matter of a day or so before the birds found it and started using it. Lots of finches, grosbeaks, sparrows and cardinals use both of the fly through holes and the sides of the feeder. Mourning doves tend to hang out on the ground and eat what drops down. Several smaller birds spent many minutes sitting on the inside, eating. The most common behavior seems to be for the birds to sit in one of the holes and eat seeds from the outside of the feeder by sticking their head out. After two days, we noticed the birds came and went in waves based on our activity, however, this feeder attracts a lot of birds and has caused them to largely ignore our multi-seed feeder. The feeder was more than half empty in just three days. Also, I haven&#8217;t seen a single bird get caught or hung up in the feeder like other reviewers have mentioned.Because this feeder is all metal, I expect it will last a good while. It is well designed, and visually interesting. It does dump a lot of seed during the filling process, but most feeders do. Based on the large number of birds it attracts and the overall ease of use, I give it a full five stars. TL;DR:",

This might have worked if the mesh squares hadn't been so large!  The instructions suggest using only sunflower seeds or peanuts, since smaller seeds would fall through the mesh.  Well, sunflower seeds fell through the mesh, too!This thing is a mess to fill, since seeds pour out as you're trying to fill the feeder.  When I realized what was happening, I tried filling it over a cardboard box (to catch all the seed that poured out), but even once it was filled I saw that it was leaking seed all over the place.  I couldn't even carry it out to the tree where I was planning to hang it without seeds continuously leaking out from the sides and bottom.  The entire feeder is mesh, so the seeds come out everywhere.I have no idea how other customers were able to use this thing.

The feeder gets a lot of clinging bird action, much more than other wired feeders in our yard.  The birds seem to prefer the fly-through openings, and they have no problems pulling out sunflower seed through the wires.  Squirrels extract seeds too, but with difficulty.  They can wriggle through two circular holes at once, with a tail poking out one end and a head sticking out the other.  While that's comical to watch, it's not fun seeing determined squirrels try to bend and break the wire mesh.  The feeder is now off-limits to them.I like the easy-fill cap, all-metal construction, and the fact birds can land anywhere to get a seed.  It does create somewhat of a mess on the ground, but that goes with the territory of bird feeding.  I never tire watching birds at this feeder, especially during wintertime when activity is high.UPDATE:  While the second feeder I just received resembles the first feeder in looks, it is apparent Perky-Pet has cut some corners.  The wire construction (particularly where connecting with the metal framework) is shoddy workmanship.  I can easily push the interior wires in (leaving an open gap).  They used to be solidly connected (soldered) to the metal square and circle framework.  Just imagine what a pesky squirrel could do with those wires now.  The wire itself is no longer coated either, so I wonder how long it will take before rusting begins.  The easy fill cap design has also changed for the worse.  My original feeder's roof clamped down on the body so no thieving varmints could pry it off.  This new one has one of those awful buttons that supposedly locks the roof in place, but every feeder I've used that has one operates poorly.I'm disappointed Perky-Pet took a good product and turned it into junk.

It looks similar to this, but has only round holes (I like the round and square on this), a copper colored top, and a platform on the bottom.  I can't find it on Amazon to provide a link.  It has been one of the birds' favorite feeders, especially the chickadees.  I fill it with black oil sunflower seed and they like having all of the places to access the seeds.  I have trouble with deer in my feeders and they tend to leave these alone, possibly because tilting them does not allow all of the seed to fall out.  Although the feeders don't provide seed protection from the elements, they empty it quickly enough that it has never been an issue and I have never had a feeder filled with rotten seed.There are a couple of drawbacks with both feeders.  The &#34;fly through&#34; holes allow small birds to perch while eating, but they also take up a lot of space, so the feeder does not hold a whole lot.  The squirrels also can access the seed and they break the wire.  This makes it difficult to fill the feeder without losing lots of seed.  Even new a fair amount of seed comes out the sides, so I fill it over a platform feeder.  The platform the other feeder has on the bottom catches some of the seed that falls out during use.  This does not have the platform.  The other feeder's copper top is also more attractive than this plain black one.Still, this has quickly been just as popular with the birds as the copper version.  Due to the size of the holes, it is really only suitable for sunflower seeds in the shell, but that is the most popular seed in my area, so that is no problem.  I think other large seeds, such as safflower, might also work. TL;DR:",

Also, it seems that sunflower seeds are the only type of seeds that might be good for this feeder, as the holes are a little too big for small seeds.  I haven't seen any birds fly through it yet, but I'll keep watch.  I have many bird feeders and I wouldn't count this one as better or worse than the others.UPDATE: I've had the feeder for a while now and I've been monitoring it closely (as closely as one can monitor a bird-feeder).  So far no mishaps with birds' feet getting caught, thanks goodness.  There has been a really great upside, which is why I changed my rating from four to five.  It just so happens that woodpeckers love this birdfeeder!  I've seen them hanging upside down from the bottom, (red-head and all!) with their long bill, poking into the holes to get out the seeds.  Another bird I see on it often is the Brown Thrasher, which happens to be Georgia's State Bird.  I'd never seen either of those birds close up, and now it's a real treat!  Bigger birds (like Blue Jays and big Cardinals) can't eat from it because their just too big to get a solid footing, but the baby birds hop in and out of the holes.One bad thing -- squirrels can hang on to this thing and feast away like there's no tomorrow.  They are responsible for eating about 80% of the seeds! TL;DR:",

It's a neat idea and its popularity is growing in our yard, but there are a few things to be aware of.  Because it's made of a large wire mesh, there's a considerable amount of spillage when you fill it.  So make sure not to try on a surface you'll have to sweep later.  Do it at the feeding area and the ground birds will thank you. And because the seeds are only held in place be a bit of friction, all you need to do is jar the feeder a little and it's snowing sunflower seeds.  Any squirrel worth his salt will figure this out in a few minutes--just jump against the feeder and you've knocked dinner loose for the whole family.But I live in the West and we've got plenty of raptors, so squirrels aren't a problem.  House finches enjoy the feeder as do scrub jays, junkos and the occasional sparrow.  I expect the grosbeaks will mob it when they show up a little later this year.  In the East, cardinals will be attracted if you can solve the squirrel problem. Small birds can get inside, but larger birds can easily hang onto the wire mesh. It also takes the pressure off of feeders with smaller seeds, meaning the little birds also have a fair shot at a meal.So it's a little messy, but it's a neat idea for a feeder. TL;DR:",

The clinging type birds seem to love being able to chose where to eat - inside or out. If inside, they seem to enjoy being able to pick seeds from all the sides as well as top and bottom. It creates a &#34;room&#34; of sunflower seeds that seems to really enamor some of the birds.

I have not found any problems with wires sticking out or sharp edges and no birds have had any problems with the holes or getting caught.This feeder has been a real joy to watch.

It's all metal construction (except for the little plastic slide lock on the upper cable, which holds down the lid) seems decent.  It attract birds well, the smaller ones get inside easily, and it's entertaining to watch.I have a few reservations . . . .  This feeder has no perch or tray.  Birds feed from it by hanging onto the wire mesh and picking the seeds out through the mesh.  Appears difficult, and the larger birds, like cardinals, which often prefer the larger seeds (I'll get to the sunflower seed part), will not fit inside and seem to be ill-adapted to hanging off the sides.  Due to the wire mesh sides, typical small bird seed mix will leak right through the sides.  The label recommends peanuts or sunflower seeds (shelled peanuts??).  When filling, even the sunflower seeds leak quite a bit -- so, a bit messy, and not economical -- but then when hung, the birds have much difficulty digging out seed through the mesh.  It's a whole lot of work for them.The squirrels haven't seemed to have caught on yet, but they will.  When they do . . . the wire mesh sides are ready made for leaping/climbing squirrels, and I suspect over time they may wreck this thing.  (I'll update if that prediction becomes reality).I've only got one other feeder.  It has a plastic dome, tray, perch, confounds squirrels and has lasted for years.  Again, this new Perky-Pet Fly-Through thing looks great . . . but in practice, it doesn't hold a candle to my old cheap plastic reliable.UPDATE after several weeks of use:  No squirrel problems, which I credit to my locating it up under our roof overhang (inaccessible to squirrels).  However, the poor birds have great difficultly coaxing the seed out of this thing.  They have tried but mostly given up.  I give it a few hard shakes occasionally which causes some seeds to fall out onto the patio below.  On behalf of the birds, I've lowered my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars. TL;DR:",

My experience started with aBlack and Decker LPP120 Cordless Pole Saw, which is basically an electric chain saw on a stick.  An awesome product, btw, but wanting on occasion to ditch the \"stick,\" I bought theBlack and Decker LCS120 Cordless Chain Saw.  For the price, I think the B&D; chain saw is good, but it's not in the same league as this GreenWorks model.  IMO, the B&D; is definitely geared for people like me that do light trimming and nothing too thick.  For a tree trunk of any decent thickness, I think that you'd want something like this model.Overall, I'm really pleased with this chain saw.  I was skeptical at first about it being a good value, given the list (and current) price of $300.  I was very fortunate to be able to try this for free on the Vine program, but $300 is a lot of money, and I kind of expected to be disappointed in the overall value.  I am not!  It is, so far, much better than the B&D.;  For full disclosure, I haven't used this extensively, yet, but I have tried it out.  I do plan to do some more trimming over the next month as we move into the holidays, and I'll update this review if my opinion changes.Do I think it's worth the money?  Yes.  I'm not a chain saw expert, though, so I'll just try to help you by describing the advantages over the less expensive B&D; LCS120.  In other words, what do you get for that extra $170?(*) More cutting length:  this might not matter to you if you just do trimming(*) Better build quality (from what I can tell so far): the B&D; isn't bad...this is just better(*) Easier and faster chain tension adjustment:  this has a knob on the side, whereas the B&D; requires you to use the included small screwdriver to turn a small dial that is located at the base of the chain.  It's not a huge deal, but I love it.  I find myself checking and adjusting the chain more than once in a session, and it was just inconvenient to have to go through the process with the B&D.;  This model makes it so easy(*) Chain brake on the hand guard:  the B&D; does not have one.  I don't actually know how important this is, but it seems like a good safety feature if the saw kicks backs(*) Better battery location:  my B&D; just gushed oil when I filled the reservoir, and it leaked all over where the battery connects.  This battery slides down on the top and isn't in danger of that happening(*) Flat bottom surface:  so you can set it down more easily without trying to balance it.  The B&D; will tend to fall onto its side for me, but this one sits down so easilyIt is heavier than the B&D;, but really not bad, and I think it's well balanced and helps a lot with the weight.  I initially thought it would be a bigger deal than it turned out to be for me.  However, if you are looking for something very lightweight, the B&D; is definitely one to look into.On a related note, I also own a GreenWorks dethather that I bought last year.  It has held up quite well over multiple uses.  I only mention it as some more info on the brand, and that I've been happy with my experience with their products. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "Bottom line: There's a lot to like about this chain saw with regard to build quality, features and performance. However, it is equaled on all these metrics by a good corded model for a lot less. The convenience of cordless may not be worth the extra cost.Full review: Like many homeowners with a suburban-sized yard, a gas-powered chainsaw is overkill. It comes in handy when you need it, but it's unlikely to see much use during the year. That complicates maintenance, since gas equipment does not like to sit idle unless it has been properly prepped to do so.The alternative has typically been a corded electric chainsaw. A good quality electric will give you much of the performance of a gas model without any of the gas engine maintenance issues. But, you're tied to an outlet or a generator.This chainsaw takes it a step further, and is the first cordless chainsaw that is a \"real\" chainsaw. Up until now, the cordless models have been limited use tools, such as the line made by Black and Decker. I have three different B&D; cordless chainsaws and they work well, but are limited to branch trimming. I think of them as pruners more so than chainsaws.The power this puts out is simply amazing, and equals that of my favorite electric chain saw, the WORX WG300 (WORX WG300 14-Inch 3 HP 14 Amp Electric Chain Saw).The saw includes a number of great design features to make it easier and safer to use. These include an automatic bar oiling system with an easy to see oil level window, a blade brake (an essential safety feature), metal dogs (spikes) at the base of the bar to reduce kickback, and a 16 inch bar that will give you the ability to tackle a pretty formidable tree. It is easy to adjust the chain tension, and it actually comes with a very good manual (a rarity these days). The 40v battery is massive compared with the 18v models I'm used to, and gives the saw ample power.The build quality seems excellent. This has a lot of heft, but it feels well-balanced. I didn't have any problems controlling the saw in use. You do notice the weight, but no more so than a good electric, and it is lighter than a similarly-sized gas machine.It includes a nice quality carry case that has an extension to fit the bar. It works well for keeping the saw clean while it is stored in the garage. The case fits just the saw (with or without a battery installed). It would have been nice if the case were a bit larger so the charger could fit in there as well.Blade speed was more than enough to make quick work of some 10 inch diameter logs. Again, a good gas powered saw, such as a Stihl, would leave this in the dust, but unless you're felling trees for a living, a bit slower blade speed is not a problem.The problem I had was the same as with any cordless device - run time. The manufacturer claims a charge will let you go through a cord of wood. I can't say if that is accurate, but I did start having run time problems once I had been using it for about 20 minutes. You can get through a lot of wood in 20 minutes with this, but the run time is not enough for me to get through what I need it to do on a single battery. As with any other cordless device, the solution is to have 2 batteries, so one is in the charger at all times. But that adds even more cost to an already pricy tool.The other issue I had was that it takes a second or so to come up to speed. Not a big issue, but enough to be noticeable. Lastly, while the handle is OK in terms of comfort, it does not excel in that area. It needs a rounder trigger handle, and the cross bar should have some non-slip padding on it for comfort and security. Collectively, these issues drop the rating to 4 stars.So, would I recommend this? Yes, but with the caveat that you can get the same performance and features in a corded electric at about a third of the price. While freedom from a cord is worth something, I'm not sure it's worth the premium price of this model. It is worth considering, however, due to its performance and ease of use. TL;DR:",

Well \"real\" just went green. When I first used this saw I went from a 4\" branch to a 6\" to a 12+\" log and I was blown away by the power of this saw. Hot knife meet butter. And this was dead wood I was cutting thru, that is the worst on a chainsaw.The pros to this saw are;Push button start: Anyone familiar with chainsaws is also familiar with wearing yourself out just pulling the cord and trying to get it to start. Also it turns itself off if it sits too long or if the chain gets caught.Running time is easily equal to a full tank of gas in a regular chainsaw and since there is no gas, the bar & chain oil reservoir is larger, so no running out in the middle of a job. Also since there is no gas, it can sit for months without the gas going bad and gumming up the carburetor.Recharge time is fast, especially for a 40V battery.One major con is that when you run out of gas, you just refill the tank and go back to work, but with a battery powered tool, you have to recharge the battery. I wish the companies that make these tools would realize they need to come with two batteries. One to use while the other recharges.One minor con, Ice Storms! I have used my chainsaws more to clean up after ice storms than for any other reason and often there is no electricity to recharge a tool like this. Another reason more than one battery is a good idea.Overall, this is a magnificent tool! It is great for a homeowner who only needs a chainsaw every once in a while.

This cordless saw is equivalent to my Poulan Pro which I will probably never use again. I especially like this saw because it is quiet. I live in a ranch community and people are living here to get away from noise. This saw allows me to collect fire wood in places where I would othewise be disturbing the tranquility of the community. I am stunned at the battery life, and how quickly it can be recharged. By the time the battery runs down, I am run down as well. The other thing I like are the safety features. The saw is light and easy to handle and this really helps reduce stress. The chain brake works well. The other thing I really like is the ability to adjust the chain without needing tools. Just make sure you check the tightness periodically. I put a couple of drops of blue Loctite on the threads to help keep the hand tightened bar retainer from loosening. I cut through some huge 24 inch white oak today. Normally, this would be a job for my Rancher 460. While it took considerably longer with the Greenworks, it was much more pleasant and I was free from noxious exhaust and forest raping noise. I will follow up with an update after a month or so of use.Update: I use this saw routinely since initial purchase and especially during the winter months in NC. My house is at 4k feet in the Great Smokies in NC. It is heated with an outdoor wood boiler. I feed my furnace with the plentiful seasoned dead fall which litters my property and ranch community.  On a single charge, this saw will fill the bed of my Tacoma shortbed truck. I use the saw several times per week and it has never failed me. Rarely do I ever use my gas saws anymore except for really big stuff. I bought an extra battery for the saw but rarely use it. My back runs down before the saw battery. My neighbors never hear me cutting, and I can cut in areas where I might otherwise be disturbing somebody. Even if it fails on me...I will immediately purchase another because it makes cutting so much more pleasant and safe. Tip: I spray the chain with DuPont Chain Saver....my chains stay sharp even when I am cutting soiled dead fall. This Teflon product is simply amazing for this purpose. TL;DR:",

Yet when I had the opportunity to get this saw with a discount, I jumped at the chance.Out of the box no assembly is required; the only preliminary before cutting is the charging of the big 40v battery. Since I also own the Greenworks 40v leaf blower, I had a battery ready and charged for the chainsaw.From the first cut I knew I had made the right decision. This saw is much quitter than the Stihl, much easier to start, and cuts almost as well.  One charged battery goes a long way, and with a second battery in the charger I'll wear out before the batteries.  Just for fun I tried cutting a 14\" felled tree into pieces. Not a problem.I like everything about this saw. In addition to its impressive cutting ability, I like its looks, the visible oil \"tank\", the ease of tightening the chain, the included brake, and its comfort and balance.For the homeowner who does an occasional cutting chore, this might be the only chainsaw you'll need.

        "reviewText": "GreenWorks G-MAX 40V 16-inch DigiPro Brushless ChainsawNot being a chain saw aficionado, I will probably offend those of you who use a chain saw daily.  I use a chain saw infrequently.  Normally no more often than twice a year unless we have had stormy weather and if it is really stormy and I lose six trees simultaneously (3 years ago) then I call my tree guy.I do not use a chain saw on a ladder. If I can't have two feet on the ground I don't use it.  Now that I have established my credentials, I like this little saw.  It is very well made.  It is replacing an equally small electric chain saw.  I don't intend to fell forests with it, but when the occasional tree does come down, this appears that it will be able to handle it.  With that said, I am not planning on cutting down one of my trees to merely test it.  It came with very good instructions, a charger and a battery.I called the 800 number to verify that there truly is a human being answering the phone and fielding questions.  I asked if I needed to buy expensive bar and chain lubricant and I was assured a good quality, NEW not used, 10w-30 would work just fine.For some reason it runs even quieter than my electric chain saw.  It has a nice tension knob that should be a feature on my electric chain saw but isn't.  Screw driver and two wrenches were needed to change the tension on my old saw.  This has a handy dandy little knob to adjust the tension.Overall without felling a tree, it cuts better than the old electric chain saw (perhaps the brand new chain could be a factor there), it is quieter and much more user friendly. (the tension knob)  In addition, I was able to get technical support immediately and she was friendly and informative.  As far as I am concerned good customer service should weigh heavily on any purchasing decision.This appears it will give me good service and with a lithium battery, it should give me good life.  The battery and charger are warranted for two years and the saw is warranted for four.  That is hard to beat.Update: March 18,2014, after having been away from home for 2.5 months, I came home to much tree damage.  I had totally forgotten that I had this unit and was thinking I still had my electric chain saw (given away).  When I went in to get the chain saw I saw the battery and immediately assumed that it would be necessary to charge it as it hadn't been charged or used since I first wrote the review, 5 months ago.  Imagine my surprise when it fired right up, cut through branches up to 10\" in diameter as if they were butter.  The convenience of the battery, the lack of a cord and the hassle of a gas engine makes this my new favorite tool. TL;DR:",

Yep, it will suck up your leaves and carefully place them into a bag that you can empty into your mulch box (You do have one don't you?). Of course, you may be one of those who simply mow your leaves back into your lawn. It will also blow those grass clippings off of your driveway back into the lawn.Do I sound like one of those \"green\" people? Actually, our community has an ordinance prohibiting green waste from going into our landfill, so this was a lifesaver for me.The best parts:It is battery operated. I do NOT do gas powered items - sorry, they intimidate me. And, while I don't mind cords, my husband hates them, so the only way for both of us to enjoy this is the mere fact that it IS battery operated.It is \"relatively\" light. It weighs in at about 6 pounds. While I would prefer to have it lighter (I would prefer to have EVERYTHING lighter) WORX runs over 8 pounds, and Toro is 10 pounds for their blower/vacs.It is GreenWorks. I have been using other garden products of theirs for some time and have grown to appreciate the way that they have lasted for me.It is easy to use.The things that are concerns:This comes with a single battery. Replacement batteries run more than $100. Hopefully the battery lasts a long time, but if you need to use this on high for a period of time OR you have a large yard, this may not be the right one for you. On lower settings, I can use this for about an hour.This is my first blower OR vac, so I have little to compare it to, but I really do appreciate it in our 1/3 of an acre yard with 4 large trees and one small fruit tree.

        "reviewText": "Gas-powered leafblowers are powerful, but they're incredibly loud, they spew out a surprising amount of fumes, you have to keep a can of gas-oil mix just for the blower, and engine maintenance is a hassle.  So years ago I switched to a Toro electric blower, which is zero maintenance; but dealing with a 100' cord is a real hassle.  So, when I saw this GreenWorks battery-powered leafblower, I had high hopes, especially since I've been very happy with my GreenWorks G-MAX lawnmower.The blower is great for weekly cleanup.  It's lighter than I expected and produces a very strong air stream -- at least as powerful as my Toro AC powered blower that has the same MPH rating.  The speed control can be easily dialed up and down with your thumb while using the tool, so you can continuously adjust the blower to get just the right force.  Very convenient and easy to use.  I find myself using this blower ten times more often than my old blower, simply because its so simple and convenient.  It takes three seconds (literally) to grab a battery off the shelf, snap it into the blower, and get to work.The only downside of the blower (which almost caused me to drop the rating down to four stars) is that the battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes.  My GreenWorks G-MAX lawn mower runs twice as long on a single battery, so I was expecting better battery life.  The 15-20 minute run time is fine for weekly cleanups, but it means this leafblower won't be able to replace my other leafblower for fall cleanup, when I typically have to run the blower for over an hour to move mountains of fallen leaves.Bottom line:  I really like this blower for weekly cleanup.  It's lightweight, powerful, and super convenient.  It starts instantly and creates no fumes, so I tend to use it a lot more often.  It won't do hour-long leaf clearing sessions in the fall, but it's a great yard tool, especially if you own other GreenWorks G-MAX tools, since the batteries are fully interchangeable.  (Buying into the GreenWorks system of 40V G-MAX lawn tools is sort of like buying into Dewalt 18V tools.  The convenience of interchangeable batteries is huge.  I own three different GreenWorks tools and have become a huge fan of their system.) TL;DR:",

It was so easy to put together (but one thing I'd recommend to manufacture is to label the parts to the vacuum - that was the only thing that tripped me up a bit). I've never ever used any machine to pick up leaves (just a good old fashion rake!)- so I can't really compare this to anything. I was attracted to this seriously because of it's color and what appeared to be its simplicity. The charge seems to hold and the bag is easy to throw over my shoulder and then empty. I love this and would highly recommend it - with something this simple AND good looking, it might inspire more women like me (a girly girl!) to pick it up, get outside, and do some work!

It worked well for blowing cut grass and leaves from the back patio, but not so well for the really heavy leaf fall. It also didn't work too well when the leaves were wet. It was okay on dry leaves, but where there was heavy coverage, I had to go over areas a few times, but if the leaves were wet it was much less effective. I loved not having to fool around with a cord, but I just didn't find it powerful enough for bigger jobs.It's really nice to have and easier to set up and use to do the front and back porch, front walkway, but not for major heavy leaf blowing. I did notice that other reviews found it plenty powerful, so I'm wondering if maybe it is the unit I received? I can't say for sure, but based on the unit I've been using, it isn't enough for me to give away our corded blower. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "Update 12/13/13 - After using the vacuum portion for awhile to vacuum up fall leaves, one annoyance has become obvious - when you go to attach the vacuum tube to the bottom, it is very awkward to try to balance it and slide it into the slot and lock it into place.  Seems like it should be so easy, but it always takes me multiple tries and fumbling with it and sometimes when I think I've got it, then I pick it up and knock the tube on any little thing and it falls off again.  This process is very frustrating and makes me dread having to use it as vacuum.  Everything else about this blower/vac is fantastic, but that one small thing really ruins the fun and ease of using this.  Battery life continues to impress, as I haven't yet run it all the way down before completing a job.This blower vac is nice and powerful, when used at the top setting - the lower settings are not very useful as it doesn't blow hard enough at the lower settings to really accomplish much. I confess I didn't immediately see the red button that puts it into high gear, but once you push it, look out - this blower really goes to town. On max settings this blower seems to easily put out as much power as a gas powered blower - definitely more powerful than any other battery operated blower that I've tried.This blower is definitely way more powerful than my Worx 18volt li-ion cordless blower, however, it is also quite a bit larger which makes it a little less comfortable to blow grass clippings off after mowing, however I'd say the bulkier size is definitely worth it for the increased power you get.  The size/weight of this is comparable to my corded Toro vac/blower, and it performs as strongly or better than it, but you get the bonus of no power cord.The battery on this lasts about on average to other blowers, since all blowers seem to run down the batteries quickly - I was able to blow and vacuum up all my grass clippings without running the battery down, while with the Worx blower and I would have to switch batteries half way thru. So far, I have been easily able to do all by blowing/vacuuming on one charge.  If you really want to stretch the battery run time out, you can run it at a lower setting or not in high mode.I also like how easy it is to convert from blower to vac - attach the tube to the bottom and lock it in and replace the blower tube with the bag and you're ready to go.  I use this weekly for the yard, since i mulch mow - i use it as a blower to blow all the grass clippings and leaves into a pile and then switch it to vac mode to suck up the leaves and clippings to use as mulch elsewhere.  I can't wait till fall finally comes to Texas and I can try it out on all the leaves that will get dropped in the yard.As for price, I think that if you really want the power of a gas blower or corded, then this is absolutely worth every penny.  If you don't necessarily need max power and maybe only want to do light blowing of leaves or grass clippings, then maybe the cheaper non digipro version of this might be a better fit. TL;DR:",

This blower has to be used at top speed to handle that depth of leaves, and going full tilt the battery lasts half an hour max.

It comes with charger, 40v battery, blower tube, concentration nozzle  (doesn't help me concentrate), mulcher tubes, leaf bag,and operator's manual. I actually  found it challenging to find the printed in China manual since it's printed on brown recycled paper that blends in with the color of the packing box. It's an attractive tool, a little on the heavy side, but lighter than my Stihl gas blower and well balanced. But what about performance?For clearing our deck and sidewalks the low speed setting with the variable speed set to five is far more than adequate. To move lots of leaves and twigs kick into Turbo Speed and be amazed by the flying leaves and the power in your hands. Of course, the Stihl gas blower is more powerful, but for my purposes the power of the GreenWorks is more than adequate. So far one battery is all I've needed as long as I recharge the battery between uses. An hour and a half in the charger usually gets it back to full power. Unlike my NiCad Black and Decker battery powered tools, this one doesn't weaken towards the end of the battery life. It just suddenly dies. To monitor the power left, one must keep an eye on the power indicator on the battery. Depending on the settings used, I can work 20 to 30 minutes on one battery charge.Verdict on the blower - I like it so much that I'll rarely if ever use my Stihl gas blower. The low powered Black and Decker NiCad blower will go into retirement and the corded Toro will be used only on occasion. This tool is so good that I'll probably buy the Greenworks chainsaw next so I can use batteries on both.Greenworks G-Max also can be configured as a vac. I must disclose that I've never liked the vac function on any of my vac/blowers, but gave this one a fair shot just in case. For me the vac function is more trouble than it's worth even though it only takes a few minutes to remove the blower tube and install the mulcher tubes and the bag. The suction is fair at best and vacuuming is a tedious chore. I think I could easily fill a large leaf bag the old fashioned way faster than I could fill the bag attachment of the blower/vac.  I will say that the vacuum function is nice for getting leaves out of shrubbery or collecting leaves from between closely growing shrubbery in beds by the house.My only other complaint with this unit is the ON/OFF button, a slightly raised dimple on an electronic pad that's not as easy to use as a push button or lever control.Bottom line - I am pleasantly surprised by the performance of this Greenworks tool and like it enough to want to purchase more tools in its 40v family.

        "reviewText": "As others have stated, it is a very good blower with plenty of power.The 40v 4AH battery lasts almost 45 minutes, depending on the power setting -- which depends on the type of leaves and condition.Two switches control on/off and hi/low, plus a variable dial for speed. Seems to me, they could have incorporated hi/low function into the speed control because having a separate hi/low switch is an extra step.At maximum power (needed for vacuuming) it only lasts 15 minutes, so I use extra battery packs from other G-Max tools I own.The suction is insufficient for some smaller/heavier leaves -- they get sucked in, but tend not to get discharged unless broader leaves are also used, even at maximum power. Also, needle-like leaves tend to get stuck underneath the sensor wire at discharge nozzle.For this reason, I would suggest getting the blower-only model if you do not need the vacuum function.FYI - I also use Toro 51609 blower/vac which is excellent! It is AC-corded, so it is pain to drag out extension cords, but it is more powerful and the work can be done in about third of the time compared to this GreenWorks DigiPro. I use the DigiPro cordless when it is too far from the outlet, though.The charger is disappointing. It wastes power even when not charging and they say to unplug it when not in use. It is a pain when several chargers are used. Two LEDs indicate power and charging status. There is a label wrapped around the plug that explain how to interpret the LED color and blinking status.

As it turns out, the weak battery life ended up being a DEAD battery after less than 6 months.  Greenworks customer service was contacted with no mention of Vine participation.  They handled the issue very quickly and professionally, exceeding my expectations (some other reviews report less than satisfactory experiences)  After trying the new battery, I can say that it performs better than the prior one, but still goes to 2 bars within about ~15 minutes.Original review from October 2013 below....I have a Black and Decker corded electric blower/vac, and it's supposedly rated at 225 mph.  This, at 185 mph seems every bit as powerful.  The aur speed is like the PSI on a pressure washer - it can be a little misleading.  If you get a large amount of air at 185 mph, it can be more functional than a small stream of air at 225 mph.It's a little heavier than my corded blower, but the convenience far outweighs this.1) There's an odd little nozzle extension that I decided I didn't need - this also gives the blower a larger exhaust.2) Using the extra power mode eats your battery pretty darn quick. My guess is that it will last less than 15 minutes on the high setting.  That should be enough for most jobs, however.3) Charger is annoying - you have to push hard to get it to click in, then removing it is also very tricky since you have tu simultaneously release the latch which is now upside down, and pull away from you.  My wife was unable to do this after several tries.4) On/off and high/low switches are really low cost \"membrane\" switches - very small and hard to use with gloves.

So I decided to try and fit both my Weber and my electric smoker under it. While the base of my smoker is bulky and square like the top, the bottom of my Weber is just slim metal legs. So even with this grill cover cinching closed at the base, both my grill and my smoker are able to fit inside it together, as it's the bottom that's shaped more narrowly than the top.It's much softer than I expected it to be. Other grill covers I've had have been a more tarp like material. This is softer, like fabric, and drapes around the contours of the grill underneath it. The cover has sewn on handles and vent flaps on either side, and even a large pocket for keeping thing like dripping utensils.I really like the light color of this cover. It matches the siding of my house, and has a cleaner look to it than the black covers I've had in the past. The brown color blocking at the base is nice since it keeps in mind that this section of the cover would be the most likely to rub/drag against the ground, porch, garage floor, etc. Since it's the most likely section to get dirty, being dark brown helps hide what dirt might get on it.I'll be very interested to see how well this cover holds up to our brutal northern Minnesota winters. Where sub zero temperatures and non-stop snowstorms last many months every year. During these snowstorms the winds are relentless. Last year an wrought iron bistro table I had on my porch was picked up and flipped, causing the glass on the top to shatter.

If you have a medium-sized or smaller grill, you could possibly use the remaining space as a tent-style dog house, or for summertime guests.The only (very minor) nit I will pick is that the elastic bottom makes it a bit more of a struggle to get the cover fitted over the top of the grill. My old cover had parallel, non-elastic sides and it slipped easily down over the grill, using Velcro straps to cinch the sides tight so it wouldn't blow off. This cover is definitely not going to blow off, but getting it on the grill is a bit annoying and it doesn't have quite as neat of an appearance. Then again, I don't have to remember to fasten the Velcro straps like on my old cover - once this baby is in place, you're done.Definitely recommended for the price. TL;DR:",

It's been below freezing here, but not the temps we normally get around the first of February, so I have yet to see if this is a fact, but I have no doubts it will do fine as my other one is not nearly as sturdy and has gone through 5 winters so far.The design is nice and will go with my modern patio area very nicely. I have a concrete wall on each side and the color will blend in very well. I like the wavy texture on the barrel, very modern and very now.The two spigots levels are great and I'll probably never use the higher one.Holds 50 gallons, that's a lot of watering if you have a small yard or a few potted plants.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:The top design is really odd in my opinion. You would never be able to really put a real plant in this tub design as it would get washed out, especially if you have a large roof with a lot of watershed. I fill up my other 50 gal. bucket in one short rain storm, so I know this is not going to be a place for real plants to hang out. Probably will get a fake one and simply weight it down in there.I don't like the allowance for a hook-up to the downspout. This should be universal and allow for the spout to go directly into the top loosely instead of resting on top of the screen.  The screen situation is nice, but sort of unnecessary in my book, I don't get that much stuff in the gutter. Now, that said, since this would be nearly impossible to clean out (why is there no removable top on this design?) I can see why they want a screen screwed in place.Given the amount of rain we've had, mine is full already but was somewhat problematic to hook up.Great design look, poor design functionality.

Don't plan on possibly moving the rain barrel to a spot it might look nicer in once it's already placed, it will be too heavy unless you want to completely empty it out.This barrel doesn't have a great set up for attaching to a down spout. And the planter area doesn't seem the best either. My Agreen barrel has a planter with lots of tiny drainage holes. This one has just one small hole sort of on the side, not the bottom. I drilled several other ones in the bottom of the planter with a small bit. The idea is you want the plants watered, but not floating and the water to pass through into the barrel but as little soil sediment as possible to get in or you will have to take everything apart and clean it out so the spigot isn't clogged. Even then I think a shallow bed of shale before putting in your soil and plants isn't a bad idea.

It helps collect rain water which can then be used for other household purposes, helping to save money and conserve resources.I have used other rain barrels but this is the first one I have owned that is solid in construction. In fact, if I have to name one aspect of this rain barrel I like best, it would be the solid, sturdy design. It seems like it can stand up to the elements and withstand any type of inclement weather. Lucky for me, it doesn&#8217;t snow where I live but the durable design is good for those who live in harsher climates.With its attractive, neutral design, this rain barrel matches up well with most outdoor d&eacute;cor and I like that it has two spigots for convenience. There is also the ability to place a plant on top, as you can see in the picture. I haven&#8217;t done this and, given how shallow the space on top is, I don&#8217;t know if placing a plant here is really a good idea. If it was deeper, perhaps so, but it&#8217;s so shallow that most plants won&#8217;t fare very well.The things that bother me a little with this rain barrel are its lack of a removable top and issues with installation. There is a screen on top to help prevent debris and bugs from getting inside. And it&#8217;s a good thing the rain barrel has this because there is no way to open the top for cleaning. The best you could do is remove the small screen and try to find something narrow to stick through the small opening for cleaning. The screen will keep out leaves and other things, but if the barrel gets smelly and needs an interior cleaning job, there is little you can do.With the installation, I did have some small issues and concerns. You need to place this rain barrel directly under a downspout and because it is so tall, that will likely mean removing a large section of your downspout in order to fit the rain barrel underneath. Depending on your particular downspout design, it could be a problem and you may have to cut off a portion of the spout to get it situated just right. Then, there could be issues with the spigots. They provide tape to help form a good seal, but only time will tell if the seal holds up and the water doesn&#8217;t leak.Overall, however, I like the Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel and recommend it for most homes. It helps conserve water, performs adequately, and looks nice in my backyard. It could stand for some improvements, but it is still a good device for water conservation. TL;DR:",

However, having an upper one means I don't have to bend over very far when I just want to fill a watering can, and the lower one is best for watering with a hose (more pressure plus the barrel will furnish water even if only a quarter of the way full).The hardware appears to be well made. If this is your first rain barrel, consider placing it convenient to plants that are not easily reached by an existing spigot. Convenience means that you are less likely to neglect watering your plants. And if you are in a climate that gets low temperatures, don't forget to drain your barrel as winter approaches. It's best to drain it and then store it someplace where it's sheltered from extreme cold.The water that comes off your roof and through your gutters is not completely clean but it is good enough for plants.

Unfortunately, living in the suburbs also means appearance matters almost (maybe more than) function. In the past, we've purchased the Algreen rain barrels that look like big terra cotta jugs and have been happy with them more or less (B0013CJLI6 ATIN number). However, one one can never have too many rain barrels so when this came up for review, I jumped at the opportunity.PackagingThis arrived promptly and well packaged without any dings or dents. My original Algreen order had a big dent which I managed to get 'unkinked&#34; but suffice to say, this held up better. It is a big box and very cumbersome so keep this in mind especially if mobility or other related considerations are an issue.Quality of ConstructionI'd have to rate the quality of construction 'excellent'. It is molded but very thick...much more so than the Algreen 50 gal rain barrels. The planter does not have drainage which is a bit odd. The screen is thick and built-in so more stable. There is a breathing hole and two well placed spigots made out of brass. You will need to install the spigots (2 of them...tape is included to form a tight seal). These are attractive and made out of metal which looks better than the plastic but only time will tell if they hold up to rust/corrosion. There is a notable seam and for some reason, one of the spigot holes is placed adjacent to the seam making it difficult to position when attempting to hide the seam. Compared to the Algreen 50 gal barrels, this feels more substantial and of an overall better quality. Note, it does not come with a drainage hose so plan accordingly.AppearanceThis is an attractive, very neutral color, rain barrel. The picture doesn't show it as well but the entire outside is covered in a type of 'wave' pattern which I think will likely collect dirt more readily than a flat/smooth surface. The lighter color is also more likely to show it than the terra cotta Algreen barrel. All in all, this is attractive but not as attractive as the Algreen. However, it will be easy to wash off and appearance is truly in the eye of the beholder.StabilityAs you can see from the product photo, the bottom is smaller than the top although not by a lot. We set this up on a few paver/walking stones for added stability...more than ample. This is VERY heavy when filled with water so taking the time to reinforce it before allowing it to be filled is prudent.What You Will Need- Stable place for placement. When filled with water this will weigh well over 400 lbs so shifting sand/other could become a problem. We use a couple of large walking stones/pavers for support which is more than ample.- Hose. This does not come with a hose. We use remnants purchased here on Amazon.- Downspout drainage. This is designed for use with a downspout which fits over the built-in (but removable) grill screen.

The planter portion is about 8&#34; deep and is somewhat wide, you can easily get a flat of flowers in.The aesthetics however is where the beauty of this barrel ends. Unlike the Fiskars, which has a diverter to hook up to your downspout, this just has a screened inlet. There is no mechanism to attach this barrel to a downspout. The instructions tell you how to, but there is nothing to do so. Further, with the included instructions and screened method, there is nothing to stop this barrel from overflowing once the top has been reached by the water. There are also holes in the planter portion, which means the soil is going to be a soggy mess all the time unless you close those holes.

First, I like that the area on top of the barrel has a hole to keep the depression where you could have a plant from filling and holding water.  In my old rain barrel, this depression became a serious area for mosquito breeding, but in my new barrel the area will stay dry and mosquitos will have to move along.Also, I like the fact that there are two spigots, one near the top of the barrel, one near the bottom, and increasing the ease with which I can get water out of the barrel.So what&#8217;s with my judgement of &#8216;almost perfect?&#8217;  I do not care for the look of the barrel.

I eventually settled on four stars because of the easy installation, nice included hardware, and the striking aesthetics, but I'm still on the fence. This rain barrel is not without its flaws and quirks though.  As a frame of reference, I have a Fiskar's rain barrel, two barrels made by the county out of large, converted soda syrup containers, and one homemade contraption converted by  me from a large trash can.The Good Ideas barrel is relatively light and easy to install. I like that it comes with two brass spigots that screw into two pre-threaded holes.  To install the barrel I elevated it on cinder blocks to improve water flow. I also removed a segment of  drain spout and replaced it with a piece of flexible, plastic drain. The bottom end of the plastic drain piece rests firmly atop the rain barrel so that water falls into the barrel through the piece of included screening.An alternate way to install the barrel is to use a diverter like the one I installed for my Fiskars barrel. Installation requires cutting the downspout, but the inverter is then permanently in place. When the barrel is filled to capacity, the diverter then sends water down the bottom part of the downspout in the usual way.  A diverter can be purchased on the Good Ideas site.I don't particularly like the planter design on the top of the rain barrel. There's only one small hole for drainage to the front of the barrel. After a rain today I had to tilt the barrel forward to drain water from the plant cavity; this would be impossible with a full rain barrel. If the top plant cavity fills with too much water, it will drain down the front of the barrel perhaps discoloring it.  If you opt not to plant anything in the plant cavity, then some water will sit in it and perhaps attract mosquitoes.I'm also not crazy about the design for accommodating overflow, a channel around the perimeter of the top diverting water to the front of the barrel so that it cascades down against the barrel. I would prefer a system that lets the overflow be directed away from the barrel and away from the house.Amazon requires Vine reviews to be posted within 30 days of receiving the product. I'll need more time to satisfactorily evaluate this barrel, so may return and modify this review if circumstances warrant any changes or additions.UPDATE -  After watching the rain barrel function during and after ten inches of rain, I'm starting to warm up to it. The top cavity for plants works better than I thought it would. Some water remains after a rain, but it disappears within a day. I've even bought some potting soil to plant flowers up there.The overflow design also works better than anticipated; in fact the flow of water along the textured front is quite attractive. Also overflow doesn't puddle in front of the barrel as I feared. Some leaves collected on the front of the barrel from the gutter overflow, but these were easily brushed off later. TL;DR:",

Better than the rest of my rain barrels.Two spigots,  placed at 90 degrees away from each other (so if one is facing front, the other will be facing to the side.  The spigots were easy to install.The top has a plastic grid.  It has been my experience that these eventually crack and break.  You can replace them with (I know this sound strange) the plastic &#8220;canvas&#8221; that is sold for needlepointing.Having had rain barrels for years, I have a couple concerns about this one, which may or may not apply to your situation.Over time gunk tends to build up in them (from being washed off the roof) and they need to be rinsed out.  This is going to be difficult with this design, since the only hole is the one designed for the water to go in and it is about 4 inches in diameter.  There are screws over the mesh, so you would be able to dump it, but that is going to be harder than taking off a lid and cleaning it out.  That said, our lids often come off our other rain barrels, leading animals desperate for  a drink to a watery grave, which is not fun for either of us.I put dirt and flowers in the top indentation.  Water can run out from the top.  Good.  But when the rain barrel filled up quickly, then water started pouring into the plants, leaving them floating and dirt all down the side.  This is because there is no overflow valve, for which I am deducting a star.  They state a &#8220;built in overflow system&#8221; which is basically a channel along the top where the water goes in that directs the excess to the front where in theory it would run down the front of the barrel.  In practice, a solid rainstorm overwhelmed this system .  I have three other kind of rain barrels, and they all have places to attach a hose at the top, so that you can &#8220;daisy chain&#8221; them together or direct the excess flow with a hose to some other point.  And you cannot even add a connector to this rainbarrel, since the texture means there is no flat spot to drill a hole to attach a faucet.  I ended up drilling a hole and inserting a piece of wide flexible tubing, which dribbles but does help to direct the excess water into a second barrel.  If you have not used a rain barrel before, you will be surprised by how quickly they fill with water.The directions also say you need to drain it when temperatures are below freezing.  With my other barrels I have found that if they freeze, and are full, the lid just gets pushed off and the ice expands without cracking the barrel.  If they are only part full, the ice just expands up and it is not a problem.  I am not sure that this one, with that small hole, would withstand freezing.I waffled between three and four stars, since the overflow system is simply not well designed.  But this is solid construction and I like having two spigots so I went with four stars. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I have been wanting a rain barrel for some time and was happy to see this attractive \"planter\" barrel become available. We have a remote corner of our yard that has some banana trees and a compost pile that impede the water spray from the sprinkler system. Thus, some new hedge plants were not getting water and died. Reworking the sprinklers would not be worth it because the banana trees are ever changing and so is the compost pile. I wanted to find a solution to the water problem before installing more hedge plants. There is a gutter downspout near this area so it was a snap to set up this rain barrel and give it a test run! Assembly and set up of the rain barrel was easy and quick (10 minutes to get it out of the box and get the spigots installed). Next was cutting the aluminum gutter spout (I made quick work of it with a jig saw) and pushing the barrel into position. That's it!This intelligently designed barrel has a mesh filter screen on top to keep out debri. It has a planter space with its own drain hole so as not to drown whatever you put in it. It also has an overflow \"gutter\" of its own that will direct water away from the \"planter\" in the event your barrel fills to the top and can not hold anymore water. Lastly, the attractive design looks classy and \"fits in\" to our upscale home.I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend. Thanks for reading, I hope this review is helpful! TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This seems to be a nice idea to make it easy to spread fertilizer on a small urban plot that&#8217;s too small to warrant getting a traditional push spreader. It&#8217;s basically a plastic container with a battery-powered fan blade that spins and ejects granular fertilizer. However, the build quality is so poor that using it to get an even fertilizer dispersion is a hit or miss process.The battery compartment on mine was misaligned so that before I could use it I had to bend the connectors so they would contact the batteries (it takes 4 AA batteries, which are included). The compartment that houses the battery and fan blade snaps off, but the plastic is so thin and bendy that getting it back together is a chore. This does not have the build quality that gives me any measure of confidence that it will last for more than a season or two.Once I got it functioning it did spread out the fertilizer in a reasonably even spray. You can stop and start dispensing by pushing a lever at the base. Again, that&#8217;s not well-built and it sometimes jammed a bit in use.While the idea is good, the execution is very poor. If you have a small plot and don&#8217;t want to deal with a traditional broadcast or drop spreader, you&#8217;re far better off using a hand spreader or one of those new mini spreaders. The latter will take up more space than this product, but will do a better job by far. Plus, you can use better fertilizer than the stuff that comes with this, such as Milorganite. It won&#8217;t green your lawn as quickly, but it&#8217;s far longer lasting and there&#8217;s no danger of burning the lawn with too much nitrogen, or contributing to nitrogen runoff into streams.Nice idea, but not worth the trouble.

        "reviewText": "I got this for free, but at the price they are charging it is a serious premium over just basic fertilizer.  I get the concept for a small area, however there are some drawbacks over just a simple, rotary hand spreader.  My Republic, hand-crank spreader throws about 15 feet, which makes it much easier to avoid the &#34;overlap stripes&#34; of missing and double-treated areas.  This unit throws about 6 feet (when the batteries are full power, less as the power drops).  This will make it more likely to have the stripes, missed areas, and spots (because of clumping of fertilizer the impeller can't break).  The unit I got had the pre-filled jug with the spreader attached, plus a &#34;refill&#34; bag.  I became disappointed within a row or two, and drained the contents into my hand spreader.  I was done much faster and felt more sure of the results.Having said all that, if you want to fertilize a small area and you don't already own some sort of spreader it will do the trick.  You also don't have to worry about storing partial bags of leftover fertilizer, as it just stays in the jug until you need to fertilize again.  A rotary hand-spreader is about $10 and 5,000 sq ft of the same type of fertilizer is about $15 tops.  When I checked the cost of this at $33 to do 2500 sq ft...it just doesn't seem like a great bargain to me. TL;DR:",

Intuition does not work or at least did not work well for me.Turn the container upside down after reading the instructions.  Test the motor of the spreader to be sure it works satisfactorily.  Mine did not; however, this is where my electrical skills, huge overstatement, came in.  My motor would not work not even after resetting the new batteries.

        "reviewText": "OK, who hasn't laughed at the fridges that connect to the Internet.  Seriously?  C'mon.  So I had the opportunity to try out the GreenView spreader, which is battery powered (and to share my disclaimer, I was able to try the product for free, but I have zero incentive to provide anything but an honest review).I opened up the package, figured out how to slide the bottom part, and opened up the tab that sealed off the fertilizer.  Note that it does come with a full load, but you can easily refill the container.  I spent a minute or two trying to get it to work, and no luck.  Found out that one of the batteries was in crooked; once I fixed that, I was up and running!It is just plain fun AND easy to use this thing.  Just pull out the yellow tab on the bottom, and a little motor whirs to life, doing a very nice and even spread.  Just walk around and watch the fertilizer fly.  I was able to apply fertilizer to my lawn (average suburban size) in about 5 minutes.  This happens to be quicker than pulling out my giant green Scott's push-fertilizer (and much less messy).  And this product takes up less room than my old spreader; just sits on the garage shelf.  The battery life seems good.  It uses four plain old AA batteries, so in future years I'll just pop in some of my rechargeable batteries and will be good to go.The spread pattern was far more even than when my push spreader (or my small hand-cranked spreader) offers.  My old methods always seemed to have certain messy spots with too much fertilizer, and others without enough, but this makes the distribution quite even around the lawn.  The only very minor hiccup I encountered was when the spreader seemed to stop spreading, but I just had to give the handle one quick &#34;heft&#34; and the fertilizer flowed evenly after that.Bottom line, I figured I would be laughing at the product, but instead I will be laughing at the neighbors when I watch them making a mess with their giant push-spreaders.

        "reviewText": "This refillable container of GREENVIEW READY2GO SPREADER LAWN FOOD, with its battery-operated spreader attached at the bottom, is an extremely clever idea.  As the label says, this is an excellent product for use on small lawns, or on grassy areas that require maneuverability around trees, benches, walkways, or similar common yard obstructions.  To spread the fertilizer evenly and in the right amount, you simply turn the spreader on, and walk along in a strip pattern carrying the spreader by the top handle.This part was very easy, and I really liked being able to distribute the right amount without having to figure out how to apply a certain number of pounds of fertilizer per square foot.  (If you prefer doing it the old-fashioned way, this product calls for 3.2 lbs. per 1000 sq. ft.)  This fertilizer is 22-0-4 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium). In my experience, fertilizers are pretty much the same, so I'm expecting my lawn to green up (22% nitrogen) and have some protection against drought and disease (4% potassium).  There's no phosphorus in this fertilizer, because phosphorus helps with flower production.The hard part for me, was figuring out how to open the battery-operated spreader part--which must be opened to remove the seal that keeps the fertilizer contents fresh, and to remove a strip that prevents the included batteries from going dead.  To open the spreader, you turn the container upside down, then turn only the UPPER part of the green spreader to open it.  There are a couple of tabs at one end that need to be disengaged before the spreader will open--these made the spreader very difficult for me to open, every time I needed to.When you close the spreader, make very sure that you've fully engaged those pesky little tabs again!  I didn't, and when I carried the container to my lawn, it came open and dumped the entire contents on my sidewalk.  It was a pain to clean up, but not a major disaster, because I was able to pour most of the spilled lawn food back into the container.  Even when it's reassembled correctly, the spreader tends to leak some bits of lawn food, so expect it to be a little messy.The refillable container and any unused lawn food can be stored in a cool, dry place.  The compact square container takes up hardly any space, compared to even a hand-held spreader (for example,Scotts 71030 Easy Hand-Held Spreader).WARNINGS include:Use only when grass is actively growing.Do not apply by hand.Do not apply to wet grass.Do not apply during periods of drought.Water lawn thoroughly after applying.Do not apply near water, storm drains or drainage ditches; do not apply if heavy rain is expected; sweep any product that lands on the driveway, sidewalk, or street back onto your lawn.Keep out of reach of children.Use protective eyewear when using battery powered spreader.Because the battery-operated spreader portion was so hard to open, I rate this product at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).

Granted, it helps novice gardeners from making mistakes such as using a high nitrogen fertilizer on something such as tomatoes, but it also is somewhat unnecessary provided you read the formulation.This is a 10-7-7 fertilizer. The first number refers to nitrogen (helps with greening and foliage growth); the second is for phosphorus (promotes root growth); the third is for potassium (helps strengthen plant cells). It&#8217;s a good formulation for pansies but also can be used for other flowering plants.It also includes small amounts of sulfur (improves uptake of nutrients), iron (aids in plant health and improves the green color) and manganese (helps with iron absorption). All in all, a generally decent fertilizer formulation.The granules are small but not too powdery, and are uniform in size. It&#8217;s easy to spread and work into the soil. Watering after application is recommended and, given the high N content, you should take care not to get this on foliage (or wash it off if you do) to prevent burning.The cons are the cost &#8211; this is very pricey per pound, and there&#8217;s nothing special about the formulation to justify the cost. The other con is that only one-third of the nitrogen is from water insoluble sources (which for this fertilizer is feather meal, bone meal and meat meal). Water insoluble sources are important to prevent fertilizer run-off into streams and other water bodies, where it promotes algae blooms. While water soluble nitrogen works faster and gives you that quick &#8220;pop&#8221; of growth and color, it is not ideal due to run off.I&#8217;ll give this 3 stars.

Pansies need more Nitrogen (the first number in the three-number ratio) because they grow and bloom in cold weather.  When soil temps drop below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, Nitrogen from Nitrates is necessary in a pansy's diet.  When it is cold out pansies can &#34;digest&#34; Nitrogen in the form of Nitrates easier than other forms of Nitrogen.By the time I received my bag of pansy food, it was getting a little late in the season for pansies, but I hurried and got an application onto the beds.  I noticed an improvement in the bloom size and color vibrancy within a week and a half.  The grains are uniform in size (with no dust to blow away in the wind), some of them are slow release, and it was easy to work into the ground.I also liked that there were different application rates provided for beds, round pots and square pots:  Now, that's getting down to the nitty-gritty--and left no questions in my mind as to the exact amount to use.If you have any left over, be forewarned that it is not suitable for use on consumable (food production) plants.This fertilizer contains organic fertilizer in addition to more usual &#34;conventional&#34; fertilizer material:  Feather meal, meat and bone meal, kelp, diammonium phosphate, calcium nitrate, potassium sulfate, ferrous sulfate and manganese sulfate.It is not always easy to find fertilizer for blooming plants that contain Nitrate Nitrogen.  This GreenView Pansy Food has 3.4% of its 10% Nitrogen in the form of Nitrate Nitrogen.  And that is a good thing.During the warmer months--beginning sometime in March, depending on where you live--pansies can take on and thrive with less Nitrate Nitrogen and you can turn to a more balanced diet (ratio) of Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium, plus trace elements.

When they do the calculations for our extended hours of daylight in the summer months, it just may be equivalent to -or greater than-many other statesWhatever the case, this is an easy to apply and well formulated nutrient mix for your flowers.UPDATE:  AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER APPLYING (TROWELED IN) , THE PANSIES ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT NUTRIENT.  THE PANSIES HAVE SPREAD , ARE ABUNDANT AND FLOURISHING.  THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT THIS YEAR WAS THIS PANSY FOOD -DEFINITELY MADE A GREAT POSITIVE DIFFERENCE.  THE BLOSSOMS ARE LARGER AND MORE VIVID IN COLOR- NOT PEAKED LOOKING AS IN PRIOR YEARS.I LOOK FORWARD TO RE-APPLYING THE PANSY FOOD AND SEEING THE RESULT.  THIS IS A GENEROUS BAGFUL, SO THERE'S A LOT TO GO AROUND.PROBABLY BEST TO GIVE THEM SOME MORE FOOD PRIOR TO THE ALASKAN WINTER -NO DOUBT WE'LL HAVE GREATER ABUNDANCE NEXT SPRING.  THESE PANSIES HAVE BEEN IN SINCE 2007 OR SO (7 YEARS)AND GOING STRONG.  THEIR MAIN THREAT SEEMS TO BE THE UBIQUITOUS DANDELION (TOOTH OF THE LION- FRENCH) WHICH LIKE EVERYTHING IN ALASKA SEEMS TO BE BIGGER.  (Today I dug out a dandelion with a root the size of a rutabaga).Yes, everything seems to be bigger-too bad the weeds benefit from the Midnight Sun, too.  If flowers are well nourished they can hold their own against these leviathon weeds.if you like to garden, you'd like to see the fruits of your labors. Soil-Science and nutrients make a huge difference! Give this pansy food a try-it's great! TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The main differences between this and most other flower food is a higher level of nitrate nitrogen and a good dose of calcium.The nitrate nitrogen makes the fertilizer useful in prolonged cold weather (below 45 degrees), when pansies are still active but won't take up ammoniacal nitrogen. Too much ammoniacal nitrogen may also cause spindly growth during warm weather, so this formula balances the two, with a little over half the immediately available nitrogen in the nitrate form. It also includes slow release nitrogen in the form of feather, meat and bone meal.Some problems with pansy greenhouse plants have been traced to calcium deficiency. Most soils already have enough, but some growth mediums (i.e. the material the plants are typically grown and sold in), which rely on liquid fertilizers, don't. Curiously, this product doesn't include magnesium, which should also be present in soil in a certain balance with calcium to avoid boron deficiency, another particular issue with pansies.The guaranteed analysis for this 10-7-7 NPK product is 10% total nitrogen (N), including 3% ammoniacal N, 3.4% nitrate N, and 3.6% insoluble N; 7% phosphate (which gives the P number); 7% potash (the K number); 5% calcium, 4.5% of it soluble; 2.5% combined sulfur; 1% soluble iron; 0.3% soluble manganese.This 4-pound bag covers roughly 150 square feet at the recommended amount. Reapplication is recommended every 4-6 weeks.Application is easy, the granules are heavy enough not to blow away before you can lightly work them into the soil and water them.By the way, this fertilizer *is* safe for food production (contrary to what one review implies), but since it isn't organic, it isn't suitable for the production of *organic* food.The Lebanon in the manufacturer's name comes from Lebanon, Pennsylvania.

Almost all plants need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (these they need the most and are often abbreviated NPK for the chemical symbols), calcium, magnesium, and sulfur (these they need smaller amounts of, I put Epsom salt on my lilacs because they like a lot of magnesium and sulfer).  Pansies need these minerals as well as iron and manganese (called micro nutrients, they only need a little).This fertilizer is 10-7-7 or 10% Nitrogen 7% phosphorus and 7% potassium.  This is actually on the low end for percentage of active ingredients and for flowering potted plans I usually choose 15-30-15.  Since the main reasons we like pansies is the flowers, I am surprised that the 10-7-7 ratio, usually you want to reduce the nitrogen (slowing the growth) so the extra energy is put into flowering.  But I am not an expert on pansies, so perhaps they grow differently.That said, this is really expensive for the amount you get.  It&#8217;s a little dusty to apply.

The stomper definitely does the job.  I've always tamped down the leaves and grass with a scoop shovel.  That's always worked too but it's obviously not an option if you're using a bag and since the leaf stomper has more flat surface iit will compress a wider area than other tools.  I like that I can secure the rake handle into the stomper using my foot to open and close the spring loader.  One negative:  I used a lot of force to really compress my leaves.  Once done it was fairly difficult to remove the rake handle from the stomper.  There is a small indent at the bottom of the stomper to hold the rake handle.  The handle was jammed in there securely and I struggled to get it out.  I was afraid I was going to break the plastic stomper.  I didn't break it, though, and possibly if you're stomping into a bag you'll use less force and not have this problem.  But the bottom line is the stomper works and is a useful tool to add to your garden implements.  One other comment:  the stomper comes in a rigid blister pack. It's not the easiest packaging to open and requires a knife or scissors to remove the product.

        "reviewText": "There are things that people like to have around, and the EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper is one of those things. It has a purpose, and it works.The quality of the rigid plastic is excellent. It comes in a clamshell packaging in two pieces, the main shaft and the foot. Once the shaft is pressed into the foot, it's not going to come apart without some effort, though it's not supposed to. Its durable construction will stand up to any leaves or trimmings for which it is used to stomp. The stomper shaft has a strong, spring-leveraged hard-rubber grip on the inside, which opens when the rubber-coated foot pedal is depressed, most appropriately by stepping on it, in order to insert whichever garden tool handle one has at the ready.I was out of leaves, but I did have several half-barrels filled with dead tomato plants, which were long overdue to go out for green waste pickup, so I used it on those. I have garden tools with either bare wood handles, or foam rubber grip coated handles, and I used each type to test my Leaf Stomper. I started with the foam rubber grip hoe, and because I noticed a slight bit of play while stomping, it gave me the idea to try the wood only handle in it, and it wobbled a bit, too. Having thought about it, I guess it doesn't matter that it wobbled, it held in place like a champ, and it did everything it was supposed to do. It requires a diameter that will support what people might have on hand, so it was normal. This item works perfectly for what it is.If stomping leaves and trimmings were not enough, imagine the fun kids could have making footprints in the mud to pretend that there's a Bigfoot on the loose. This ten-inch stomper foot is shorter than my own foot, yet it is most definitely wider. It will easily fit into smaller bags, and it works brilliantly in my green waste bin with enough surface not to poke through things; it didn't pull anything up on its way out either.I've had to climb a stepladder before to stomp on thorny lemon tree prunings, so I guess this really would have been nice to have back then. I do recommend the EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper for those who do their own yard maintenance. It's engineered beautifully, from high-quality materials. This is a fine quality lawn care accessory, which is what my high marks reflect about the product. TL;DR:",

I was going to buy an attachment that snaps onto the top of a garbage pail and hooks up to my leaf blower/vac so I can vacuum the leaves directly into bags.  However, I realized how much more work it would be to lug the pail around with me as I vacuum the leaves.This season, I resorted to mowing the leaves and bagging them, using my foot to repeatedly stomp the volume down after each time I emptied the mower bag.  I received this item in time for my last weekend of cleanup.  It made the job so much easier.  It did a great job of compacting the leaves so I didn't have to use my foot.

This has no bearing on the function of the stomper, just a heads-up for those who suffer from 'wrap rage'.Once it was freed from the packaging the stomper is in two pieces that easily snap together. Put it on the ground, press the foot pedal, attach a broom handle - I had a broken one lying around - and it's ready to go.The first thing I noticed was the size of the foot. It's smaller than I expected and another couple of inches might make it even easier to compress the leaves.The product description states that it allows packing up to 4X more in a standard recycling bag - that may be true if you never attempted to pack down the leaves at all. I was already compressing the leaves so I saw no real change in volume but it does make the job much easier. Previously I would jump in the bag and stop the leaves with my feet. Probably not the safest thing to do once the bag gets over half full and begins to tip over with me trying to get out of it. I was happy to find a safe, alternative way to stomp that accomplished the same task.Overall, a nice little gadget to help with yard cleanup. TL;DR:",

This is not for the clumsy or accident prone.Even though it is December in WI, we found enough leaves in our garage to get a bag of leaves going.

This strikes me as a Shark Tank type of inventor project but I think it will be of use next fall when we are again inundated with leaves. I think children would have fun tamping leaves with this but again I'd hesitate to have them use this as illustrated. Get a dowel and have this be a dedicated tool.ETA: 4/5/2014: it is now spring and the melting snow has uncovered a surprising amount of leaves!

I used to buy cheap department store hoses, but they usually didn&#8217;t last and would kink a lot.  The last time around I spent a bit more and got a better quality hose.  I found it was thicker and more durable, but still kinked often - even though it was advertises as &#8220;no kink.&#8221;  I have a lot of landscaping and as I wind around shrubs, flowers, rocks, trees, and paving, I almost always end up with a hose kinked, or stuck on something.  Then I have to stop what I am trying to do, go back and free up the hose, etc.Enter the Scotts MaxFex.  While it is still winter and my use of this hose has been limited, I have used it to wash the cars and flush a gutter.The hose measures 50 feet in length.  The couplings appear to be brass; they are marketed as being lead free.  The entire hose is advertised as lead-free, which makes it &#8220;drinking water safe.&#8221;This is not an inexpensive hose.  However, for the extra $10 or $20 you may spend, to me &#8211; it is well worth it.  The hose is clearly made very well.  The couplings are heavy duty and the hose has a nice feel to it.  You can see and feel that it is reinforced.  It has what Scotts calls &#8220;Lay Flat&#8221; technology.  Basically it tends to keep its shape, which helps it resist kinks.  They refer to it as being &#8220;kink resistant&#8221; which I am fine with, as I hate to buy a &#8220;kink free&#8221; hoses that kink.  At least here, they are telling you it should avoid kinks, but &#8211; just about anything flexible can kink.I keep my hoses in storage containers made for that purpose (decorative with a cylinder in the middle to wrap the hose around).  Even with my decent hoses, I tend to have to fight and exert some strength to roll the hose around and around into the container.  Yet with the MaxFlex, I found it recoiled quite nicely, allowing me to more easily roll it into the storage container.In the short time I have had it, this hose has demonstrated an ability to maintain shape, recoil very easily, and to avoid kinks.  In fact, not a single kink yet &#8211; again I have used it just 2 or 3 times.What has really pleased me is the way it keeps its shape and tends to continue to slide around things as you pull it, rather than become snagged on things.  People often complain about a hose that kinks, but to me snagging on things is just as bad.  I hate having to stop what I am doing, retrace my steps and go free up the hose from whatever it got caught on.  So far, this hose has tended to slide freely around objects and hasn&#8217;t snagged &#8211; even once.I will update the review as I continue to use it.To me, this hose is well worth the extra cost versus an average hose.

But the problem with so many garden hoses on the market is that most of them are low in quality and cannot be used without experiencing frustration. These garden hoses may not cost much, but they cause endless headaches and are ultimately not worth the savings.I have used my share of these lesser garden hoses and have found that cost cutting is not worth it. A good garden hose is worth the money and the Scotts MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose is one that everyone should consider. A full 50 feet in length, this hose is made to last and designed to resist some of the common problems associated with cheaper hoses.My favorite feature with this garden hose is that it doesn&#8217;t kink. In fact, of all the issues associated with garden hoses, the tendency to kink is the most frustrating. This is what I was talking about when I said that cheaper hoses aren&#8217;t worth the savings. Most all of these less expensive hoses kink and fold up continuously. You end up spending a good amount of time undoing the kinks to restore water flow. This Scott&#8217;s hose doesn&#8217;t kink. It is lined with a heavy duty vinyl covering that keeps the hose straight and the coating doesn&#8217;t peel.Once you&#8217;re finished with the Scotts MaxFlex Premium Heavy Duty Garden Hose, it rolls up easily for storage, ready for future use. Yes, the price of this hose is a little steep, but it is definitely a quality product and for the headaches it prevents, the extra dollars are easily worth it. TL;DR:",

The last remnants of the loops flatten out into meanders. If you are dragging the hose and there are still full coils, those coils seem to even out in both size and spacing, unlike many of my other hoses, and this may be a result of the hose &#34;relaxing&#34; into this state.Several of the other reviews here report that they had a problem with kinking. I have seen no evidence of situations that lead to that. It may be because I have been using the hose in warm weather (mid-70s to low-80s). Or it may be my usage pattern. When I want to extend the hose to a set position, I don't drag it, but carry and uncoil. When I am dragging a hose during watering, I am moving slowly, which gives the &#34;Lay-Flat technology&#34; time to balance out the coils and avoid the situations that I see leading to kinking with other hoses.When I am done using the hose, it has curled nicely -- it has memory of being curled, but little bias about the diameter (I have done a medium and large diameter).The female hose connector is wonderfully large. I had no problem gripping it even with muddy hands.Experience: I have used (deployed) this hose about 6 times in the month I have had it (I received the product in exchange for an honest, timely review).-- Douglas B.

        "reviewText": "The Scotts MaxFlex hose is wonderful.  I cannot review all the features the hose is advertised as having due to the cold weather here (and everywhere).  I can tell you what I have learned this far.We used it the day after receiving it, and it came just in time to prevent what could have been a catastrophe. Our winter has been horrid, not unlike most of the USA.  Our snowfall for the winter is double the normal amounts and it has piled high in our yard, driveway and walks coupled with sub-freezing temperatures.  I believe it was almost a full month in our area where the temperature never got above 20 degrees or maybe it did get into the low 20's.Suddenly we had a couple of days of warmer weather coupled with thunderstorms that caused flooding conditions in our yard.  With a driveway that slopes downward toward our house the melting snow and rain brought a cascade of water toward our garage door.  There is a grating with a drain at the lower end of the driveway that normally handles any torrential rainfall without problems.  This time it was overwhelmed.We have a submersible pump that we use for draining our hot tub when it is time to clean it and many hoses as well to use with it.  Unfortunately, the hoses were stored in an outdoor shed which could not be reached due to a 3-4 foot high snow accumulation covering the yard.  Plus, they are all 75 feet in length which causes a diminished flow rate when pumping.  Hot tub maintenance isn't urgent so they worked fine for that purpose.The new Scotts MaxFlex was 50 feet long and it hooked up perfectly to the submersible pump.  The hose instructions caution you to begin the hose initial setup in 70 degree + temperatures, and we could only partially do that.  The indoor temperature where the hose was stored was in that temperature range, but outside it was about 35 degrees at the time.  The female fitting coupling is brass not plastic and is larger than the normal coupling.  It measures 1 1/2\" in diameter, making it simple and easy to connect and disconnect. No tools needed to tighten or loosen and absolutely no leaks at the joint.  Once we made the hose connection and turned on the pump the shorter length let the water fly out of the hose and it kept up with the massive melting with ease.  We could pump the water out past the part of the driveway that slopes downward and out toward the storm sewers in the street.The hose did unroll easily, and did lay flat without kinks or curling, but the \"snap back\" feature wasn't even tried.  By the time the water flow had ceased, almost 2 1/2 hours, the hose was virtually frozen.  Soft and pliable at the start it was quite rigid when we pulled it into the garage.  We just dragged it in and put it anywhere we could so we were finally able to close the garage door and get out of the cold.  We did not attempt to recoil it because of the coldness that night, but it remained unkinked as it laid on the floor.  By the following morning it seemed it had attempted to recoil itself, but because it was all wrapped around chairs and benches in the garage that was not doable.  We were able to manually recoil it without difficulty later that afternoon once it had warmed.  There is a white or light yellow line about 1/8\" wide running the length of the hose that I suppose is to let you know if the hose is twisted.  We were only concerned with the urgency to remove the water as any flooding in the garage area would have continued into the recreation area of our home that is on the same level as the garage floor.  I did not look to see if there was any twisting in the hose that day, but in the summer that would be a benefit if twisting would prevent the anti-kinking feature.My opinion, given the task it was given to perform, even though it may cost more than cheaper hoses, is that this is an extraordinary value for a garden hose.  We always keep our hoses in a \"roll-up\" storage case and it always proves impossible to reroll the hose because it curls and kinks as it rewinds.  This hose will never suffer those troubles.It is the best!By the way, we can finally see bits of grass in our yard after weeks and weeks of constant snowfall.  Of course, the weekend forecast is for up to an additional 13\" of snow!  Hasn't this been a wonderful winter?

A big thank you to whoever came up with this design.  Another welcome feature is that the hose curls the way I want it to.  I keep it in a large pot, so I want a larger circle of hose and not the tight ring it came in.  It was so easy to place it neatly in the pot, and it willingly goes back into the new, looser curl.  The hose it replaced wanted to curl tightly, even after years of use, so it was always tangled.  I have four garden hoses, and this is by far my favorite.  Eventually I'll replace the other three with Scott's MaxFlex - it is the best garden hose I've ever owned.Added 5/6/2014: I have learned that I need to carefully unwind this hose out of the pot.  If I simply pull it out of the pot as I walk across the yard, it will kink in multiple places.

If there was a weakness to any of their products it was the couplings on their cheaper hoses. I haven't had that problem in recent years. Swan makes almost every American made hose out there. That includes this Scott MaxFlex hose. So it was a no brainer to take this one for a test run. After four weeks use these are my thoughts.Timing was perfect. I was going to replace my older camping hose anyway. Measuring in at 5/8\" x 50' and weighing a little over seven pounds this Scott version is lighter then my older hose. I'm alright with that. The lead free aluminum couplings are not new features by any means. Most of Swan's hoses have been outfitted with these for quite some time. Still it works. I like the re-enforced vinyl covering. Unlike the cheap imported knock offs, its first rate and won't fray or peel. I can even live with the yellow line.On my first real test I laid the hose out to the max. I ran water through it a couple of times and drained it. Unfortunately the lay flat technology didn't show up. Even with the hose filled with water it still has a tendency to kink. For fresh water use its treated with bacteria and mold inhibitors. Still nothing gets rid of the taste of a new hose except constant use.

For me personally I find this hose to be an average tool for camping or light gardening.The couplings on this product are first rate and definitely the best part of this hose.

The two warm spring days in the Chicagoland area we have had thus far were spent teaching one of the kids to ride their bike and not cleaning cars.  Regardless, I rolled out the hose on a rather chilly spring day and gave it a shot.The temperature when I used the hose was 48F.  Why am I mentioning this?  The directions on the hose recommend setting the hose up when it is above 70F.  Despite being well below the recommended temperature, the hose did indeed lay flat on the ground as advertised.  Despite being left out overnight in around freezing temperatures and being only around 50F when I used it, the hose remained soft and pliable in the cool weather, even after running cold water through it.  It remained easy to coil up by hand while my other &#8220;good&#8221; hose was stiff and would only easily make large loops when I tried to coil it up by hand.Walking around the yard, I personally did not experience any kinks in the hose nor did I see any portion of the hose threatening to kink if I pulled it tight.  It remained fairly flat to the ground and did not bunch up.I thought the connectors to the hose were excellent.  Prior to obtaining this hose, I had no idea that the quality of hose connectors varied.  The female end of the hose is large and textured.  This makes it easy to grab and the design of the connector makes it incredibly easy to thread the fitting on the spigot.  I did not have to fight with the fitting to get it threaded on the spigot like I did with my other hoses.  The male end is just as easy.  The hose attachment threads right onto the hose fitting.The only drawback I had with this hose was the female fitting.  I ensured the washer was in place and that it was seated into the female fitting, but the connection still leaked.  I tried it on several different spigots and attaching it to the male end of another hose but the hose still leaked at the female fitting.  In all due fairness this hose leaked a lot less than my other hoses when I tried those.  Perhaps this is being caused by the cold shrinking the rubber washer.  For now, I am deducting a star for that reason.  If it works better when it gets above 70F, I will adjust my rating accordingly.If someone had told me that it was a worthwhile investment to spend around $1 per foot on a garden hose, I would have thought they were out of their mind.  I would have said that my 100 foot hose I got from a warehouse store for $30 works just fine.  However, after trying a quality hose like this one, I will be replacing my cheap hoses as soon as funds allow.  I highly recommend this hose!  Fighting with stiff hoses that bunch up and kink every time tension is put on them will be a thing of the past! TL;DR:",

Yes, mostly.Before this hose, I went to the Big Box Store and paid over 5 ten dollar bills for a premium hose.  The result - after one year of use, it was leaking from the connector (where it connects to the hose material), it kinks every time I use it and it has become stiff as a board.  Its last act of defiance was developing a crack and leaking somewhere down the line.I almost wrote a bad review for this hose 2 days after I received it.  When I first hooked it up, getting this hose to stay on my hose hanger was like wrestling with a boa constrictor.  It wanted to go its own way and I couldn't get it to stay where I wanted it when stretched out.  So I stretched the hose out and let it stay fully extended for 2 days...now it is very easy to manage.I am impressed that this hose is drinking water safe, probably because it is lead-free.  I don't drink from a hose but it is good to know it does not contain trace amounts of lead.  I am also impressed by the connectors on this hose - top quality.  I'm willing to bet this thing will last a while.After a week of use, I find that this hose still kinks from time to time but mostly behaves.  It is light years better than the one I had before.  My only regret is not buying the 75' length. TL;DR:",

The hosing is more rugged, the valves are more rugged, the hose doesn't kink that easily.

The stripe is much more noticeable than you would expect from the product page photo, although it's not all that hard to get used to.Unlike the cheap garden hoses that I've been using, this hose is made of \"drinking water safe\" materials, and includes a \"bacteria/mold inhibitor\" to protect the hose.

As the instructions say, \"Water left in a hose for extended periods of time may result in the formation of bacteria.\"This garden hose does NOT kink easily, and it's easy to coil back onto the hose holder after use.  To maximize the hose life, I always drain out some water after I turn off the spigot, because I use a \"control-top\" garden spray nozzle.  Sunlight or cold can expand the water left inside, and cause the hose to burst or leak prematurely.  The instructions recommend storing the hose indoors \"when not in use\", which I think means during the winter months.The hose has a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials or workmanship \"under normal, residential, non-commercial use, for the 'Warranty Period'\".

        "reviewText": "I \"KNOW\" hoses! Having spent my entire life as a landscaper, the only people who handle hoses more than I do are firefighters!The primary purpose of a hose is simple: deliver LIFE-SAVING water to plants. Yeah, you can fill a child's swimming pool, wash your car, and clean the sidewalk but the main reason why garden hoses were invented was to deliver water from the spigot to your garden, without you becoming \"Jack & Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pain of water.\"That's why I'm CONSTANTLY confused as to the \"WHY?\" people that spend $100's and $1,000's of dollars on their landscaping, will go the CHEAPEST ROUTE POSSIBLE, in regards to the most basic of garden equipment. WHY, people, WHY?If you buy a GREAT quality hose (and this is one of them), it can literally last you decades. If you truly care for it as a valuable piece of equipment, it can last you a lifetime. So, skip those 150' hoses that sell for $20 bucks that kink as soon as you unwrap them, blow their walls from the constant P.S.I. that is required to contain the water, and couplings so fragile, that one single accidental tug will break the seal, allowing water to leak everywhere.So, \"How Do You Know A Hose Is Worth The Money?\" First, ask your landscaper! See what THEY use! If you don't have a landscaper, go with quality brand names such as \"Swan\" and \"Gilmore\". Although this hose is sold under the \"Scott's\" brand name, it's manufactured by SWAN, a hose company that I've used for decades of hard/daily use.Start with the couplings that connect a hose to your spigot: Are they solid? Are they brass? Are they of substantial weight? In this hose, the answer is \"Yes!\" to all of these questions. The couplings are actually oversized, with a nice tooled \"grippy\" surface, making it easy to connect to your spigot.Then, a critical piece: DOES IT HAVE AN ATTACHED WASHER! A 'washer' is that little rubber 'thingy' that seals the connection between hose and spigot....often times, when your hose is 'leaking' at the spigot, it's because you've lost the washer. This is VERY easy to happen: when the hose has been attached to the spigot for a fair amount of time, when you unscrew it, often the washer will become 'stuck' to the end of the spigot, then falls off, and you've lost it for good. Be sure that you always check your hose for the washer, every time you take it off of the spigot. Now, in the online sale of this hose, the washer is INSIDE the coupling, where they always used to be placed. In stores, because of the high THEFT factor from people stealing them to replace lost ones at home, they are usually threaded through the cables that bind the hose together. NEVER BUY A HOSE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A WASHER!Okay, you've checked the coupling. You've got a washer. Now what? There should be a good 4\"-5\" area, directly under the coupling that has either a brass spring or hard rubber area, that keeps the hose rigid at the spigot, so the weight of the hose doesn't kink immediately, cutting off your water supply. THIS hose has a very nice black rubber collar that is 4\" in length, preventing all future kinks at the water source. Swan calls their collar \"Hose Armor\"...cute. :DNow, as to the hose: IS IT HEAVY? Weight is everything with a hose and a standard 5/8\" hose that's even 50 feet long, should weigh A LOT, even when bone dry. That weight equals the heft of the walls and reinforcement of the hose's construction. The weight on this hose is substantial.Next, look at the walls of the hose: is there a pattern or waffling along the walls, indicating that they are reinforced. The walls are very reinforced on this hose, allowing it to hold the 40 p.s.i. (40 pounds per square inch of pressure) that is standard from homes.Added bonuses to THIS hose include: 1) Drinking water safe, which is important if pets or kids or even landscapers are going to be quenching their thirst from this hose! 2) An inhibitor against mold/bacteria has treated the hose. It doesn't say \"where\", I'm guessing it's the actual material. and 3) The brass coupling is LEAD-FREE, especially important for safe water delivery to you, your fish pond, your kids or pets.Two more notes: NEVER BUY MORE HOSE THAN YOU NEED 90% OF THE TIME!!! If you ONLY need 40' of hose 90% of the time, then owning a 100-150 foot hose is Overkill to the Extreme! Not only does that bulk of the hose get nasty that's not constantly used, from being in soil, dirt and mud, but that's the area that mold can build up in the hose, when not in use. Plus, the area not used is almost certain to ultimately kink, simply because it's not being used and sitting in the same position for months/years will age it. If you only need an additional 25-50 feet of hose 2-3 times per year, then buy ANOTHER HOSE to hook up to the female end of the hose, and then detach it and hang it up to dry when not in use, then coil it up and attach the coils with cable ties.Second note: ALWAYS DRAIN AND BRING YOUR HOSE INDOORS FOR WINTER! Nothing ages a hose more than being left outside, attached to your spigot. Not only can water freeze in the hose, driving it into the spigot and your home, but the ice expands and can rip a hole in the side of the hose. Drain the hose by removing it from the spigot, lay it flat on your lawn, then pick up an end and begin coiling it up, allowing the hose to dictate the direction it wants to be coiled. This makes it easy to store and also drains all the trapped water inside of it. Attach together with joined cable ties and you've now Winterized your hose for the following year. And store your precious nozzle away from freezing, too. Just be sure to check that the nozzle's washer is also inside the unit when you put it away.If you follow these steps about buying a QUALITY HOSE and how to STORE IT, you'll be passing this along to your grandchildren!

I haven't come across a better made or more versatile injector. It performs exceptionally well and is obviously very durable as it is made of heavy stainless steel. The needle shaft is as large as any others I have come across yet still inserts easily into whatever meat you are injecting. I do own one very similar injector but the other one lacks the second needle which is for minced marinades. The standard needle has the smaller holes along all the sides of the needle shaft. and no hole at the end of the needle. That needle is great for injecting meats with the store bought injectable marinades, or if you are like me, you can quickly make your own on the stove in a single pan for much cheaper and with better flavor. By minced marinades, I mean being able to use finely minced fresh garlic instead of the powdered garlic and using finely diced jalapeno peppers and such. The mince needle doesn't have any of the smaller holes along the shaft which would quickly clog up when using any marinade containing ingredients much bigger than coarsely ground black pepper. I've even had those smaller holes clog up while using similar injector needles when using marinades containing larger-type dried seasonings such as basil and it's no fun when that happens. Instead, the mince needle has one large hole at the tip which is cut diagonally allowing the most space possible for larger seasonings to exit. Even with the standard needle with holes up and down the shaft, to distribute your marinade evenly so you don't end up with large season pockets, you need to insert the needle into the meat and then slowly pull the needle out while pushing down on the plunger. This is of course even more important with only the one hole at the tip of the needle. With practice, you will be cooking the most moist and best seasoned meats possible with the center of the meat being just as favorable as the outside.

I prepared a turkey tenderloin using a mixture of melted butter, fresh minced sage, and salt an pepper. Basic I know but delicious! The tip allows for minced herbs to injected easily. It penetrates the meat well and easily, allowing buttery sage-y goodness to infuse the turkey.Clean up is a breeze due to its dishwasher safe status.

        "reviewText": "I think leaf mulch is the best, my county even recycles the leaf collection back to the public as a branded product.  I compared this product to my TORO handheld electric blower/mulcher with chrome impellar and a Craftsman gasoline chipper, mainly ued for branches and incidentally leaves.Packaging is pretty good and everything arrived undamaged.  It was pretty easy to assemble; I did not even need to use instructions!  The legs are made from aluminum and are height adjustable (with measurement markings).  Even if you are fairly short or tall, you should be able to set the height to your liking.  The rest of it is made from sturdy plastic.  The motor is quite strong and since it's electric will require barely any maintenance.  The cutting mechanism is merely heavy guage weed wacker string.For dry leaves and thick twigs, I thought this shredder worked fairly well.  I mounted it inside my garbage can, since I didn't have any wide mouth bags that would fit (and it doesn't come with one...)  Ear protection and eye protection are a must as this thing gets very loud and the top is fairly open and could potentiall throw twigs out.  After the first couple handful of leaves, the fine dust coats the hopper and makes most of the leaves slide into the shredder easily.  Sometimes, I used long twigs to help it along.  I confess, it was tempting to use my hands to mush the leaves in, but if you look into the mouth of the shredder, you realize it will take your fingers off and mangle your hand, in less than a second.  I fed this machine a mix of dry pear leaves, pine needles, and twigs of varying sizes.  What I got was some nice mulch quickly which I then dumped promptly into my garden bed. I also got a runny nose from all the fine dust, so if you have a surgical mask, I recommend you wear that too.  The legs pop off easily and I store all the pieces inside one of those very large black plastic disposable planters.For comparison, the SunJoe is is farily well built compared to the other two tools I mentioned above.  You have to have a lot of patience with the TORO if you are going to mulch a large pile of leaves with it since the vacuum intake is a bit smaller and long twigs jam it up pretty easily.  The Craftman is like bringing a bulldozer to a garden bed if all you want to do it mulch leaves and twigs.  As a one-task machine, the SunJoe works quite well. TL;DR:",

I feel like giving leaves, which could be a good fertilizer, to someone else to mulch is wasteful, the carbon footprint of the truck that picks up the bags is wasteful, and the bags themselves are wasteful.  But of course if you leave your leaves on the ground, they kill the grass.  This electric leaf shredder is (almost) exactly what I always wanted.PROS:+ The big one of course is that this solves the wastefulness problem outlined above.+ Makes nutrient-mulch for your garden.  This is easy to distribute and I just rake it in a bit.+ Collects in whatever bag or container you prefer+ Easy set-up+ Has settings for dry or wet leaves/clippings+ Has settings for fine, medium, or coarse grind, or pine needles.+ Height-adjustable+ Comes with replacement cutting line (like weed-whacker line but thicker)+ Easy to string replacement line+ Very fast with dry leaves+ Teenagers less likely to avoid leaf chores as they see this as both effort-saving and cool.CONS:- Loud loud LOUD!  The first time we tried it we thought it was going to explode.- Damp leaves can be mulched almost as quickly as dry, but they need a little help.  I use the butt of my rake to push them down; they just don't slide as easily down the hopper as dry leaves.BOTTOM LINE:Saves some effort as opposed to bagging, is less wasteful than bagging/collecting, makes a nice mulch for your garden, time-efficient with dry leaves - less so with wet.TIP:  Wear glasses in case of blowback.

        "reviewText": "This is basically a weed wacker head that is mounted at the base of a large funnel. The spinning line rips apart the leaves you feed through the top, reducing the volume by a considerable amount (in theory, at least).The build quality is pretty good. It's mainly plastic, but the hopper is reasonably sturdy.  I also liked that it was packed well by the manufacturer in the box, so it can withstand being bounced around by UPS.It has legs that can be adjusted so you can position a yard waste bag under the discharge chute, which is held in place by an elastic cord. That worked sort of OK in holding the bag. I had much better luck using the hopper on top of a garbage can with a bag in it. That keeps the side blow back to a minimum, ensures the collection bag does not fall off, and provides for a more sturdy work platform.The motor certainly has some power to it - it's a 13 amp motor which spins the head at a no load speed of 8,000 rpm (as listed in the manual). The cutting head has two attachment points for the cutting line. No tools are needed for line replacement - just feed the line through the holes and loop it to attach. The result is that there are 4 cutting lines. The stock cutting line is 0.1 inch in diameter, so it's something you can pick up in a bulk spool instead of having to buy the replacements from SunJoe.There's an adjustment lever on the side that allows you to select how fine you want the leaves chopped. The adjustment lever turns a plate at the bottom of the hopper which determines how much time the leaves spend in contact with the cutting line. A fine level closes off the holes, keeping the leaves in contact longer for more chopping. A coarse level lets the leaves fall through quicker, and thus does not subject them to as much chopping.It worked great on dry leaves. I had a sack of leaves that I keep forgetting to put out on the curb, so they have been drying to the point of being quite crisp. The mulcher went to town on those - just mowed right through and created a pretty fine leaf mulch. It also processed the leaves pretty quickly.But, when it came to fresher leaves, the performance was not nearly as good. Even though the leaves were only a bit damp, the mulcher struggled to get through them in a manner that made a significant reduction in their volume. It was much, much less effective (in terms of volume reduction) than using a handheld blower vac. It was also more time consuming, since it you have to feed the hopper slowly to prevent an overload.I then tried some really wet leaves. Even with the control lever set to the wet leaf setting, the strings just could not get through them. The motor labored even with just a modest amount in the hopper.The problem is with the cutting lines - it needs to have more than 4 lines or, better yet, a combination of string lines and plastic \"blades\" to get through anything other than bone dry leaves. A handheld blower vac works better since it has a spinning set of plastic or metal blades. That's a far more effective chopping device than 4 pieces of string trimmer line.I tried using some better quality string line (some twisted Gator line) instead of the stock line. That helped a little, but not enough to make a big difference.This does have some value, especially if you have to pay for leaf pickup (some localities charge by the bag for pickup). It certainly is easier on the back than hauling around a blower vac. But the limited effectiveness it has on damp leaves (and VERY limited effectiveness on truly wet leaves), plus the slow processing speed keeps my rating at 3 stars.I'd also suggest cross-shopping this with the WORX WG430. It's a very similar device, but it has a better system for holding the bag in place (uses a ring rather than elastic cords). The cutting mechanism of the WORX (or other similar models) is the same as this one, however, so it will also struggle with less than crispy dry leaves. TL;DR:",

I was surprised by how much went through untouched on the coarsest setting. But, most was much smaller. This time of the year, the grass isn't tall enough to mow, so I couldn't test that shredder feature yet.Bottom line in use: it does chop up leaves. Comparatively, a line trimmer dipped into a trash can will do a similar job without the cost and storage of another item, but it is much messier. Yes, I have done that by fitting a plastic bag cover around the top of the trimmer and over the trash can. This machine is neater, quicker and easier, though.The assembly was very easy and the instructions were well written. The telescoping legs are a definite plus both in use and for storage. Extra lines are included. It will easily disassemble and store in it's original box. Since the height is infinitely adjustable, I'm going to experiment with using it for an out feed surface for my table saw the rest of the year.Recommended for those who have a lot of leaves they want to compost or shred for mulch.

I'm not sure and can't say what it'd be like to use this leaf shredder with wet leaves. I used to live in Washington during college and the leaves never crunched, they were always soggy. I can say, if it works as well with wet leaves, then there is sure to be less dust than what we got.This shredder also packs away pretty nicely. Which is great since it's a once or twice a year type of thing. We're having a much better time shredding leaves, making mulch to use in our garden!

I had no trouble assembling it; it's pretty intuitive and straightforward even without reading the directions.  The legs are telescopic so they can be adjusted to the height of your collection receptacle without having to resort to make-shift measures.  Shredder Joe can also be set for wet or dry leaves and for pine needles.  When you're dealing with dry leaves, you can choose between coarse, medium or fine settings as well.  It does an excellent job on the dry ones and even leaves that are damp.  Understandably, the really wet ones can present more of a problem.  Once the leaves have been processed, you can decide whether to dispose of them or use them as nutrient-rich mulch. TL;DR:",

Light, fluffy, dry leaves work great; wet, sticky ones not so well.  Sticks break the line.The plastic on this feels a bit cheaper, but not by much.  It was a little easier to assemble, mainly because I had trouble getting the stand to fit in the holes on the Flowtron. Because the legs are independent on this, there were no issues with things lining up.I like that the legs are adjustable on the Sun Joe.  I had to jerry-rig a collection container (big plastic garden tub on top of a box) with the Flowtron.  With this, I can adjust the height to fit over the tub.  Attaching a bag with the bungee cords that both units have doesn't work as well as I would have hoped.  When the bags get half-full, they tend to pull out of the elastic.  I also tried putting the Flowtron over a garbage can lined with a heavy duty garbage bag, but when the bag was full it was impossible to lift it out of the can without tearing even the heaviest-weight bag.  Shredding over a bin (which needed to be close to the bottom of the shredder or the leaves went everywhere) and dumping the bin into a bag works best for me.The good thing about the Flowtron is that the whole unit pivots on the stand.  This made it easier to remove the filled bins or bags and also to change the line.  The angle on the line on this unit has the line hitting the bottom of the frame, which seems to wear it out quicker.  I also found the line easier to install on the Flowtron, possibly because of the greater flexibility of their line (I have only used the same brands as the shredder).This is much easier to store than the Flowtron.  The top half clips into the bottom, making it very easy to remove and nest together.  The legs can be unsnapped or shortened and the whole thing put on a shelf.  The Flowtron is best left fully assembled.Basically, I prefer the Flowtron, but if the price difference is big or storage is an issue, either one would work well.

I dreaded trying to get them to the front curb, so this item arrived just at the right time.The Sun Joe does exactly what it promises to do. It mulches leaves so they are easier to dispose of or use as garden mulch. It's loud, but you wouldn't expect anything else. It's very easy to use. Just attach your bag or set it over a can and turn it on.It offers multiple settings, so you can get a fine or coarse grind, depending on what you plan to do with your mulch. I prefer the finer grind since it takes up less space and should decompose quicker. There is a setting for wet leaves, but I didn't have any wet leaves to try. I should have saved some for a rainy day, but we were having so much fun that we cleaned up the yard before we realized it! I also didn't have pine needles, so I couldn't test that setting. The leaves that I did mulch seemed to be of a consistent size and it really did do a good job at it.This isn't my first experience with a product of this type. I used to have a Flowtron Leaf Eater (LE-900) and loved it, but it finally bit the dust. The Sun Joe seems to as effective than the Flowtron.

This needs dry leaves slowly fed into it for it to shred them properly. It can not handle any wet leaves (and when are leaves totally dry?) nor can it handle sticks/branches of any kind.If you are looking at reducing the amount of yard waste you place at the curb, you might instead consider a vacuum/blower that shreds leaves as it goes. The power of suction will normally create a better end result and they can handle items other than dry leaves slightly better.Now if you have a composting bin/box and are looking for something to allow you to shred leaves finely for that and can take the time to sort your leaves to select dry ones without sticks, then this device will work for you. But honestly you are the exception and I am guessing that most people think they can dump leaves randomly into this and not overload it...that just isn't the case.If this had metal teeth that could handle sticks and was designed to limit the intake better so it could handle dumping large amounts in, then it would be a 5 star product--even at the higher price required.

It works similarly to a grease screen to cover a pan when cooking bacon, to help prevent the pops from burning someone. The cover doesn't block every spark, but it helps contain some of the larger ones.The pit itself is sturdy and it's easy to add logs and move wood around, without worrying about bending the legs or something toppling over.

However it's nice that one was included.Having a fire up above the ground in a pit like this seems to make for a lot more heat as well. We don't need to sit quite as close to the fire to get warm, since the pit sits up a bit and the heat radiates out really well.

The four legs are held on with allen screws and nuts, which will likely rust in a year or so and be unremovable anyway.  Sharp edges abound during assembly, so wear some protective gloves.  When assembled the legs are not all square to the frame - it looks like the plates welded to them where the screws go through are not all lined up.  The coating on the steel is a flat black paint, which may or may not hold up for a year or two.  After that, I would think it will be mostly brown with rust, especially the screen where heat will oxidize the paint off.  The thin, vinyl cover that came with it is useless -- it's too tight and the sharp corners on the legs already have torn its seams.  I just threw it out, since it's not going to keep the fire pit from rusting anyway.Is there anything I like about it?  Well, the burning area is spacious and will fit the standard 16\" split wood with room to spare.  I also like the air holes that are covered with angle iron on the bottom.  This will allow some air up through the fire and drain any water that gets in.But if you are going to spend this much money on a fire pit, I would definitely look at the copper ones by CobraCo instead.  Copper will last longer and I think is more attractive than flat black steel.

        "reviewText": "The CobraCo fire pit (FPSMISN-B) is a sturdy, attractive addition to any backyard.  It's easy to assemble, it comes with a mesh spark guard and a vinyl cover, and wood burns beautifully.Here's the low-down:1) Assembly takes about 10 minutes - all you need to do is attach the four legs to the base of the fire pit using nuts, bolts, and a hex wrench (included).  There's a small handle that needs to be attached to the center of the spark guard, but that's it.  We were up and ready to go in no time.2) Starting a fire is a cinch - I used two small strips of fire-starter (left over from the winter fireplace season), two small logs, and a whole lot of branches we gathered from the woods behind our house.  In less than a minute, we had a nice fire going, and we were able to keep it going easily for about 90 minutes.3) Fire pit stays reasonably cool during burning - in spite of the many warnings in the instructions, I didn't find that the unit got particularly hot while the fire was burning.  The legs actually stay cool (which is a good thing, since they are the things you're more likely to brush against while you're sitting around the pit), and the sides of the pit itself do get hot, but not enough to burn you.  I touched it in several places, just to check, and did not find it uncomfortably hot.4) We loved sitting around the fire - it was a gorgeous evening, and the fire was beautiful.  We spend about 90 minutes out on our patio as everything got dark around us - the fire crackled and it smelled amazing.There are a few negatives:1) It's not perfectly square - there were some small bends/imperfections in the fire pit that were somewhat noticeable, especially when the legs were attached.  This isn't a serious problem (and it in no way affected the usability of the fire pit), but this is a fairly expensive item, and I expected it to look better.2) The spark guard doesn't fit very well - in fact, it's difficult to get the thing to sit squarely on the fire pit.  This is less of a problem in daylight, or when there's no fire in the pit, but we had a bit of a problem getting the screen to sit properly on the pit once the sun had set and the fire was going.3) The spark guard doesn't really prevent sparks from flying - we noticed almost as many sparks rising with the spark guard on as we did without it.  Since we had our fire pit on a concrete patio quite a distance from our house (or any other flammable area), it wasn't a problem for us.  We actually used the pit without the fire guard for most of the evening.  But if you're planning to use this closer to a deck or house, just be aware that the spark guard isn't a guarantee that sparks won't escape.Bottom line, this is a very nice feature to our backyard, and I have no doubt we will use it many, many times.  As the instructions state, please don't use this on a wooden deck or anywhere near your house.  It's best placed on concrete or dirt so you can relax and not worry about what the sparks might ignite.  Please check out the pictures I've posted, which should give you a good idea of how this fire pit works.  I do recommend it. TL;DR:",

The proper size hex key is included and no other tools are required. The pieces fit together well and the holes lined-up, which is sometimes not the case. There are some sharp edges, so proceed with some caution. I did not need to wear protective gloves, but being aware there may be rough spots, for me, prevented possible cuts.When I checked, the live chat on the manufacturer's website was not operational so I phoned the adventgarddendecor customer service department to find out if they could replace missing or damaged screws, bolts, washers and brackets since that sometimes happens, and it was not addressed in the FAQ area of their website. The answer is yes, just call or email them but if the unit is purchased through Amazon, rather than their website, they will ask for a copy of the Amazon receipt.The fire pit is reasonably sturdy and since it is powder coated, should resist rusting although from experience, when not in use, I will take pains to keep it sheltered from the elements. I appreciate the included cover but am already thinking about its replacement. The vinyl is pretty thin and it only has a simple elastic enclosed bottom hem to keep it in place. I am not sure it will stay on securely with even a moderate amount of wind. If the cover had hook and loop (Velcro) straps that wrapped around the legs it might be more secure, although with flimsy vinyl, the straps sometimes tear off.The Mission style design is handsome and basic enough that it should work well with a number of different architectural styles. The instructions have the usual, but important warnings about keeping the fire pit away from not just combustible surfaces (house siding included) and off of wood decks, but also suggests keeping sand, water and/or fire extinguisher nearby. It was also suggested, and I complied, that a one inch layer of sand be placed in the base of the pit to serve as insulation to protect the bottom from extreme heat.A handy long handled hook is included to lift and remove the heated spark guard (top) from the base, although it feels a little flimsy so keeping a fire resistant mitt nearby might be a good idea. Wood, charcoal and self-starting logs can all be burned in the pit but for the cleanest burn, use hardwood.  Using cold water to extinguish the fire may stress the metal and shorten its life, so sand might be a better option. With my last fire pit, I promptly used a wire brush on any areas of rust that appeared and then touched-up the areas with high temperature paint. A little maintenance went a long way.What I like about this fire pit is that the metal mesh used on the base and spark guard is quite fine so it should keep most embers and sparks within its framework. My previous fire pit had mesh with much larger holes. This appears to be a much safer fire pit. I am impressed with the appearance and construction although the lifting tool and vinyl cover are flimsy. I will update the review as I continue to use the fire pit. TL;DR:",

Neither would keep me from purchasing this fire pit. The first is it feels a little lightweight, given the picture and price. Second, the cover is a throwaway. I will either have to purchase a substitute cover or resolve to lug the fire pit to the garage.We have enjoyed our CobraCo Steel Mission Fire Pit at least once every weekend since its assembly and look forward to many more summer nights around the fire.

        "reviewText": "This is the first paint sprayer system I've owned, so this review is coming from the perspective of a novice.First, I found the system very easy to assemble. The instructions were very clear, and I had no problem understanding how to put the system together and use it. I did have a bit of problem mastering the technique of paint spraying, and I don't think I fully have it yet, but I'm sure that will come in time. I tended to want to hold the sprayer a bit closer to the surface of the object I was spraying (in this case some shutters and trim on the outside of my garage) than was advised in the instructions, which resulted in the paint being sprayed a bit more thickly than I wanted. Again, that's my fault and not the sprayer. The instructions, as I said were very clear as to how to use the sprayer. Also, even though I was warned by a few people that there would be a lot of overspray, I didn't mask the non-painted areas off as well as I probably should have. The Flexio is pretty accurate as far as where the paint goes, but there is still a fair amount of overspray, so I will be more careful next time.Cleanup was easy, although there are a lot of little parts that need to be disassembled. Again, great instructions from Wagner, so I wasn't afraid to completely break the Flexio down to clean it. I was happy that Wagner also included a small brush to use to help clean away all the paint from the unit. Once it was disassembled and flushed/brushed out, the whole unit came away very clean, and it was easy to put it back together again.As a novice to paint sprayers, I was very pleased with the Flexio 590, and I can honestly say that it is a great product, and easy to operate, even for someone with little to no experience. I can't wait to tackle more paint jobs with it! TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "When it comes to interior projects, I prefer a roller/brush for walls and ceilings.  For pieces of furniture or other items which I can paint outside, I usually want to use a spray can.  So for this latter group of work, I decided to get Wagner&#8217;s Flexio 590.  While this sprayer is really good at minimizing overspray, in general when you spray paint into the air you end up with mist or overspray, no matter how careful you are.  I must say, if you do want to use a sprayer inside, this one is great at keeping residue to a bare minimum.What&#8217;s in the box?&#8226; The 590 spray gun&#8226; iSpray nozzle/canister&#8226; Detail nozzle/canister&#8226; User Guide&#8226; Carrying caseSet up is simple, and everything connects together easily.  This sprayer can be used to apply unthinned &#8220;residential&#8221; paints.  It also can handle just about any other paint product.  You can change the sprayer and flow settings to apply latex and oil-based paints, stains, sealers, and polyurethene.  I have used it on Benjamin Moore satin paint as well as an outdoor deck stain I use (Wolman semi-transparent- Cedar color).While I don&#8217;t think the deck stain came out any better than when I brushed it on, it certainly came out no worse, and I was done in less than half the time.  I used the iSpray nozzle for the bulk of the deck floor, then used the Detail nozzle for the balusters, railings, and areas close to my house siding, etc.  I am usually outside a whole day staining the deck.  Thanks to the Flexio, I was done in only a 2-3 of hours, including protecting areas from overspray.The paints I have used, such as the BJ Regal satin, went on flawlessly when applied to drywall.The nozzle settings allow you to modify the width of what you spray, the paint flow and, using the X-Boost dial, you can adjust the airflow.This sprayer works very well.  Keeping it clean is key, and the manual covers that, with instructions on cleaning the nozzle and flushing the unit.  I think any painting tool needs to be properly cleaned, even a brush, or you can ruin it &#8211; the Flexio 590 is no exception.  But cleanup is pretty simple as all the parts requiring cleaning can be easily disassembled and washed.I also refinished a metal lamppost on my front lawn using a thick, oil based paint (Rustoleum) and it worked great.  I did need to clean off the nozzle a few times, but if you&#8217;ve used this paint in a can, it can be thick.  I did not thin the Rustoleum and it was fine, but a lamppost is a small job.  For a large area, you may need to test and decide if you need to thin it.  But for what I did, the Wagner sprayed the paint on just fine, unmixed.Wagner backs this product with a 1 year warranty.I will update this review if I run into any problems with the sprayer, or other performance notes.  But for now, this thing is a clear winner. TL;DR:",

However, not having to have our arms over our head and climb up and down stools to paint overhead was fabulous.This also worked great on some bathroom cabinets we refaced and painted. Smooth, with no brush lines. For the finishing I found the smaller detail sprayer to be a bit finicky and preferred just cutting in with a small corner brush. However, this is an excellent choice for any large projects, it covers smoothly and quickly and is great for those hard to reach overhead projects. TL;DR:",

Just remember to put the fan flat and use a front to back motion instead of side to side to keep an even coat of paint with each pass. Don't tip it past 45degrees though as it does mention in the instructions that paint could flow the wrong way if you do. I had no problem the entire time I use this to paint a ceiling in the house. Tipping it forward isn't as much of an issue, just keep in mind that you need to keep the pickup tube in the paint though.I found the ability to swap on the fly the spray width of the larger tank is quite handy when getting to windows and other items you want to get nice clean coverage around.The smaller detail tank works wonders for getting smaller jobs done and allowed me to get everything I needed done without issue.My brother has had the smaller cheaper units of these Wagner painters and always had issues with them. I've already used this model on several jobs over the last couple weeks and it has just proven to be a work horse. It just keeps spraying and the best part is I didn't have to buy all kinds of different brushes, rollers and so. Just tape... I'd rather spend a longer time taping things off than having to mess with brushes and rollers. I was able to do an 8 foot high by 13 foot wall inside of 10 minutes or less. I probably should have kept track of that a little better but it just went so fast. Granted that was for each coat but normally that big of a wall would have taken 3 times that amount of time with a roller and splattered paint everywhere. I didn't have much go any farther than a few inches from the base of the wall and so much more was actually on the wall instead of wasted in a roller, the pan and on the floor from flinging off the wall.Playing with the power will give you different effects in how the paint looks in the end for texture.If you want to really make things go fast you want to kind of treat the spray gun like an automotive paint gun works. pull the trigger just a little bit to initiate the turbine, once it's spooled up then pull the trigger the rest of the way to initiate the paint spray. At the end of each pass only let up so that the paint spray stops but the turbine keeps going. Doing this will make keep your passes consistent and even. Much like is done in the automotive industry.So spend the extra cash on a better sprayer and paint to your hearts content... I've had no issues so far with this unit. TL;DR:",

So with that said, I've used this for painting interior walls, using thick, not-thinned, latex paint.  And for me, it did much better than expected.The paint went on with very even coverage as long as you just sweep the sprayer back and forth.  As opposed to hand painting, the amount of paint used versus the amount of paint needed is significant - I used maybe half of what I had used prior with a paintbrush.  Granted, the coat of paint is much thinner, but that's also a good thing - it dried much faster, and if needed, I can apply another coat.  (So far, I don't see any reason to apply another coat.)The setup of this was easy - just add some paint, screw on the sprayer you want to use (small one for detailing jobs, big one for big jobs), and have at it.  You can change the amount of paint being sprayed as well as the force that the turbine blows the paint out (which, for latex paint, needs to stay at one of the more powerful settings.)All in all, this is a great painting system, and for the admittedly limited number of painting projects I've been able to use it on so far, I'd recommend it highly.  If you're painting more than a few walls, you'll probably get a return on investment for this system since you'll be using much less paint (and it goes a lot faster than manually painting, too!)

The smaller bottle has a detail finisher nozzle for fine spraying projects and depending on the paint will probably needs some diluting.  Adjustments are fairly simple and easy to use.  One of the best ways to practice using this sprayer is to go outside and just use water in the sprayer and play with the adjustments without any paint worries or cleanup.  That way you can see just how this sprayer works.  This is the perfect product to paint the fence. This is one area where overspray is not really much of a problem.  The hardest part of using the sprayer is the taping and prep work required for each project.  Also cleanup is still the major part of any painting project.  Latex paints can be cleaned with soap and water.  Oil base paints will require mineral spirits and possible soaking of spray nozzles.  That is the one area where I can see a problem developing and that is with clogged spray nozzles.  Keeping these clear and spraying free is going to be the challenge with this and any other sprayer.

My husband doesn't have a DIY bone in his body, and I'm too thrifty (ok cheap) to pay someone to do something I can do myself... even if it's something I pretty much hate. Yes, I admit it... I hate painting. However I also like freshly painted walls and change my decorating tastes frequently, so I've painted every room in each of our last 3 houses at least once, usually a couple times each. I've spilled a full gallon of paint on the carpet (thank goodness for owning carpet cleaners), I've ruined paint brushes by not washing them well enough, wasted lots of money on rollers because the thought of even trying to wash them was too daunting after being exhausted from painting rooms, I've cursed and complained and yet still continued to paint those walls.After trying this sprayer once all I thought to myself is \" YOU IDIOT!!!!

It's nothing like that.The directions are detailed and clear, parts are easy to figure out and put together.

Of course, there is a bit of a learning curve, so it's great that Wagner provides test boards so you can get used to the sprayer.Having a wide sprayer and detail sprayer, with their own canisters gives a lot of flexibility on the types of projects you can tackle with this thing. The wide sprayer works great with straight up paint, but the detail sprayer needs the paint to be thin down quite a bit in order to spray it. With both nozzles, you still need to mask the areas you don't want painted. Even though there isn't much overspray, you will get paint where you don't want it to be, specially little specks of it. The Wagner allows you to control how much paint is sprayed and the speed of the turbine for more precise control.My only issue is that it does feel a bit heavy and tired my arms frequently.

This Wagner Flexio 590 Indoor/Outdoor Hand Held Sprayer System will give me the professional smooth finishes I need in my painting in way, way less time. This system comes with the X-Boost Turbine handle, the iSpray nozzle, the detail finish nozzle, 2 filters in the Turbine handle, 2 funnels, a practice spray poster, thinning accessory, a carrying case to hold everything in and the owner's manual.  The directions are extremely thorough and after reading everything and practicing using this sprayer's 2 different nozzles, you will be so pleased with the perfect professional results, you will not want to use a brush or roller ever again.As with all paint jobs, prep work is everything, and it is no different with a hand held sprayer. You want to clean whatever it is you are painting first and mask the border. I found the overspray to be minimal with this sprayer, but masking is still needed. Once you are ready for painting, just be sure you do a couple of practice sprays first, to get the feel of the sprayer and to see how keeping the handle straight and steady with even sweeping motions will keep the sprayer from spitting or spraying too thin or thick. You'll see that moving constantly and distance is everything also. When you first use the practice poster with the iSpray nozzle, you will see that you will be 6-12 inches away to get a spray of 10 to 12 inches wide. Then when you practice with the detail finish nozzle, you'll find you'll spray 1 to 6 inches away for a spray 1/2 inch to 3 inches wide. Steady, straight sweeping motions will give you perfect results.Once you mix the material you will be using, you will want to adjust the controls by setting your air power and material flow control. The materials you use with the iSpray nozzle can be from thin sealers to medium polyurethanes to heavy latex paints or primers. The incredible thing about this iSpray nozzle is that you don't have to thin the materials with water. You can thin them if you like, as it will mean cleaning the nozzle hole less while painting, but I found that when I sprayed constantly and steadily for a while the sprayer didn't clog or spit until I stopped to rest my arm and began again. At this point I simply unclogged the sprayer hole with the thinning accessory, did a practice spray and went back to spraying again. The thinning accessory tells you how much water to add to the container to thin your paint or material besides having a tip to keep the nozzle hole clean.As for the detail finish nozzle, this sprayer hole is so tiny, you absolutely have to thin your material no matter what you are using to paint or stain with. Thinning is a must for this detail nozzle and you will be impressed with the perfect results you will get. For both nozzles, you can adjust the spray shape, but you can only adjust the spray width on the iShape nozzle.The owner's manual also covers proper spraying techniques for both wide and detailed spraying. I find that simply practicing will give you all you need in learning distance and adjustments to get the results you need. When finished painting, cleanup is unbelievably easy. You basically want to flush the unit with water half full for water based materials or one quarter full of mineral spirits for oil based materials. After flushing, you just take the nozzle apart and I just let it soak in a bucket of soapy water. Then take a soft brush to it, dry and remember to use vaseline on the O ring before putting it back together again. The reassembly of the nozzle is pictured in the manual, so you don't have any worries after it's apart in pieces. The only maintenance you'll have is cleaning the 2 filters and cleaning the air valve tube on the iSpray nozzle.Painting is a huge job, with lots of prep work and cleanup time, so anything that cuts down on the actual time spent painting is a huge plus for me and this Wagner sprayer makes it so much easier with it's super fast wide and detailed sprayers, which can be mastered with just a little practice. Walls, baseboards, trims, ceilings, fences, house siding, furniture, decks and even crafts turn out with a beautiful professional smooth finish when spraying with this great sprayer system and it is definitely a 4 1/2 Star time saver.

        "reviewText": "The Q2200 description states that it is fully assembled.When I requested this grill (the Q 2200) though Vine, I was especially excited that it stated it was FULLY ASSEMBLED. When it arrived I discovered the truth - it is &#34;generally assembled&#34; but has some parts that need to be assembled, and I don't just mean sliding things in place.The lid is held on by pegs with cotter pins, (not too bad, except one hole wasn't fully drilled and I had to pound it through on one side). The front handle must be assembled (3 parts) with screws using a Philips head screwdriver. the control pops on, as does the ignition button. Of course, you need to slide the drip collector (with disposable aluminum holder) on, and put in the extra heavy (most of the 45 pounds) grate in place.The heavy weight grill impressed me, and the sides flip up and fold under for carrying or protection from the elements. Best of all, it uses EITHER size of the small disposable propane cylinders! No worry about finding the correct size. You can buy an adapter and hook this up to a large refillable propane tank if you would like.I enjoy having the small size (I buy 16 oz tanks) so that it is even more portable and perfect for a tailgating party. It also allows me to keep several extras on hand. I use them for both my grill and my &#34;emergency&#34; stove in case of power outage.This lights easily and has a high lid for a roast (or small turkey). Having come from California, I love being able to BBQ a turkey on my grill. The wide handle makes it easy to control the flame, and the thermometer in the lid makes it easy to monitor the temperature during your cooking.It is much more portable than my larger grill and yet is large enough to cook meals for the four of us without trouble. Everything (except the weight of the grate) makes this easy to handle and carry, and the heavier grate means nicely seared steaks.IF this had been described correctly (partially assembled) I would have given it five stars. I am giving it four, because I think it is important to catch buyer's attention and let them know to expect a bit of assembly, not because it is a less than five star product. TL;DR:",

I've cooked steaks and chicken on it so far.  It cooks easily,  and uniformly, and tastes great.  Make sure you use the drip pan to avoid a mess.  They don't need to be replaced very often, and are easy to find online or at box stores.It's roomy enough to cook steaks or chicken breasts ( the big Costco ones) for about 4 people.

The biggest differences I can tell is the grate now comes in TWO pieces and heating controls are redesigned.  The Weber Q2000 looks more sleek and rounder.Time has also taken a toll on the appearance on my old Q200. Also I have had to replace the burner once and the ignition part that sparks inside the grill when the push button ignition is pushed. Those are parts that over the years get coated with juices from the meats you cook and also rust over with time. I also once replaced the gas regulator. The replacement arts are very inexpensive. I was able to get the ignition part and gas regulator directly from Weber and purchased the burner on Amazon.  So just remember when it comes to replacement parts, Amazon and Weber are great options to get them at reasonable prices.I already possess the grill standWeber 6549 Weber Q Rolling Cartand cover which will work with the Q2000. It typically sits on my deck with a 20lb propane tank. The grill is perfect to take along on fishing and camping trips and use portable small 16 ounce propane tanks. The grill's cast iron porcelain-enameled grates will last forever. They heat up quickly and cook evenly. Another great accessory is the Griddle insert for making scramble eggs and breakfast. I highly recommend investing in a wire brush to keep the burner holes clean from food and burnt in grease.I like to use a cover on the grill because it sits out in the open on my deck. If you don't have a cover on it, the drip trays will fill up with water and spill over on days it rains because of the rounded shape of the grill. The drip trays are great since they are just aluminum trays that are removable and you just throw them away. However they are not easy to find. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find them, not even retail hardware chain stores carry them in our area. Here is the link to the drip trays:Weber 6415 Small 7-1/2-Inch-by-5-inch Aluminum Drip Pans, Set of 10Overall I love my Weber Grill and I would prefer this type of grill to those big stainless steel types.

        "reviewText": "Already owning a weber genesis I was excited to take a look at the Q series &#34;portable&#34; line of Weber grills. The 3200 model is the premier model in the line of 5 Q series grills, with all the others being a &#34;Tabletop&#34; version. The 3200 is similar to the 2000 versions however it comes with a stand. At first I was a little disappointed that this was plastic. Being used to the build quality of the Genesis series I was surprised.... however it quickly became apparent that my concerns were not warranted and this is a smart design choice by Weber. The use of a heavy duty plastic results in a dramatic reduction in weight without a loss of it feeling solid. I was able to put the unit together in under an hour without any assistance. The documentation is clear and the instructions guided me through to completion without issue. The grill is well designed, as with all Weber grills I have owned or used, the attention to detail shows the quality of this grill. The built in handle light is a nice addition which I had purchased for the genesis, this comes included with the 3200. The side tables fold down and click back together with a substantial lock. The design of the grill plate is clever, the cast porcelain coated plates actually incorporate a flavorizer bar just below the grill bars allowing for a much more compact unit without sacrificing the key functions of the bigger grills in the Weber family.The lid is aluminum coated to reduce the weight of the unit, which can easily be lifted by two people without any strain (one could do it in a pinch). I was able to roll this around with one hand. Ideal for throwing on a truck for tailgating before the game and with the tables folding down the footprint for transporting is not too big. Weber's standard drip tray is also incorporated with the unit meaning standard parts can be purchased for use. There is incorporated holder for the propane tank - electric ignition and dual burners - one outside ring and a central burner from left to right this allows for configuration of indirect heat if required.Again you are getting Weber's quality and from my understanding their warranty service is outstanding - I have never had to utilize it though, their products have served me that well in the past. Due to the winter weather this has seen very limited use but as soon as it warms up a bit I look forward to lighting this baby up some more! TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I have had Webers before and they are my grill of choice. They distinguish themselves with the best grills I have ever encountered: nice heavy porcelain cast iron. The grills heat evenly and provide great results.I have only had propane Webers before. So I was very intrigued about how an electric grill would work and the results. Well the results are fantastic. The body is very well engineered. It provides a nice seal which essentially makes the grill a convection oven. The taste is very 'clean'. but you still get grill flavor. But your seasoning and the nice quick sear is what is giving you flavor. There is no slight gas flavor, which is a plus to me.Steaks have come out heavenly. But bone-in chicken, wow. Moist, crisp, tender, juicy. I put it perhaps a little past medium high as recommended for the chicken but it came out great. The steaks were on high and so juicy.There are a couple of limitations to be aware of. There is a suggested 20 minute warm up time before you put food down. I have followed this. Certainly for steaks on high you want the grill to be nice and warm. But you should be aware of that before ordering if that is a concern. Second there is 'only' a 6 foot cord and they suggest you don't use an extension cord. This is a problem for us and I would suspect for others. We can reach an outlet from a table, but it is stretched across off the ground. Not good if you have little kids. Of course if you buy a cart this is not a problem.One other small suggestion. Put the handle on before you attach the cover in back to the main body. It was awkward to attach the handle after the top was connected. But overall very little assembly.Even with the small issues this was easily a 5. I am finding myself not wanting to use my other grills. If you are in a situation without having access to propane or charcoal, bam this guy will have you grilling as well as anyone else. But even without having any limitations, I really like the easy temp control and not having to buy propane this grill affords. And the results are delicious. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "Probably like a lot of folks, I used to own a different brand grill and often wondered \"What's the big deal about Weber?\" and assumed it was just marketing for some sort of adequate, but overpriced, grill.  Then years ago I replaced my old grill with a Weber Genesis....and I never looked back.  The quality was great.  So when the need arose for a portable grill, I didn't look much further than Weber.I actually have the Q1200 and the Q2000.I do not do a lot of camping or tailgating, but I like to have this available for the occasional \"picnic type\" BBQ, like on a short trip down the shore.I have also used it for a party at home, when I wanted to have some auxiliary grill space.  I find it extremely useful when I am grilling something that might cook faster than what's on my main grill, and/or takes up less space (hot dogs, grilled veggies, etc.).Someone who has an apartment, but maybe not a lot of patio or deck space might enjoy this type of grill as well.So, what's in the box?  The grill, already assembled, except for the handle!  Set up took less than 15 minutes, some of which was cutting open the box.Whereas my larger Weber grill has three straight burners which ruin across the length of the grill, both the Q1200 and Q2000 have a rectangular burner.  Lighting is a breeze, with your basic piezo spark starter, and heat distribution is very good.  You can adjust the heat, low, medium, and high, like full-size Webers, but since these have one burner, you need to reposition meat to sear it, etc. as opposed to lowering/raising, or turning off one burner.While portable, the Q2000 is still a decent size for cooking.  Fully open it's about 51\" wide (including the tables), about 26\" high and about 2 feet deep.  The cooking surface is about 280 square inches.The Q1200 is a little smaller at just under 41\" wide (again, with the tables extended), about 24 \" high, and 20 \" deep. The Q1200 has 189 square inches of cooking surface.  In cooking terms that's about 7 or 8 hamburger patties for the Q1200 versus 10 or 11 patties on the Q2000.  The Q2000 is 12,000 BTUs, while the Q1200 is 8,500 BTUs.The grill surface consists of two cast iron grills, which is a smaller, but similar design to Weber full-size grills.  They are porcelain enameled.You have to place the grill on a raised surface like a table, as it does not come with a raised stand.  The built in stand keeps it just a few inches off a surface.  Weber does sell an optional raised stand.  The built in stand also has two folding tables on it, which come in handy for keeping food, condiments, plates, etc. on them.The Q series grills are fueled by 14.1 or 16.4 ounce LP canisters.  Like a raised stand, you can buy an optional adapter so you can connect a full-size propane tank.I have seen other reviews which say the Q2000 does not have a grease drip tray.  Both my grills include one.  They have a removable metal drip pan.  My box also included one disposable aluminum tray.  I recommend these on any grill, as it makes it easy to throw these out and replace them, rather than clean the more permanent drip pan.On my wish list would be a built in thermometer for all Q series grills.  While I have meat thermometers (stand-alone and built into meat forks), I like a built-in one just to show me general heat ranges.  Some Q series grills have a thermometer (Q1200 & Q2200) built in (150 to 600 degrees).Overall, this is a great portable grill.  Whether your use is camping, tail-gating, at home, etc.  the Q Series grills are a great value.  Weber backs it with a 2 year overall warranty, as well as 5 years on the cookbox, grates, lid, burners and plastic surfaces.  Basically it's a 5 year warranty, but 2 years on paint, etc. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This Review is for the Weber Q 2400 Electric Grill.Webers are just great grills no matter which one you decide on. The Q series are just neat little grills that are so versatile. I have a huge mega burner rotisserie stainless thing that just sits there now that I have used a Weber Q. They are just simple and don't require a whole lot of anything to use and clean. Plus you can move them all over easily since they weigh so little.I have, and still use, a Weber Q series propane grill model 230 that has a taller grill lid in case I want to do a turkey. Thought at the time I would do some turkeys two years ago, so far haven't grilled a big bird. List of things to do I guess.The downside to the propane other than keeping tabs on the amount of fuel in the tank so you don't run out half way through is that the regulators are very temperamental and you never know how long it will take you to get it started. The safety feature shuts off the main valve if it is hit with full force gas, like turning the tank valve on. It can take up to five minutes later for the safety valve to stand down and let it flow. So yeah thats a pain, and it does not always do it so you have the excitement of never knowing if it will ignite now or later.The electric is a great model. The only downside I have found is that it has no temperature gauge like the propane. That seems just stupid, as a gauge is really necessary on grills for proper cooking unless you like everything rare or burnt. Ok maybe thats an exaggeration but it is helpful to know the cooking temp.The electric is easier in most ways than the propane to operate, and cook with. Either way you are not going to go wrong thats for sure. Like the propane it has two grates that can easily be cleaned, and this model of the electric has two heating elements.Here are the official specs on this model and this model only.

I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the way charcoal flavors food, but now that we have a toddler who loves being outside, so we have happily traded the taste of charcoal for the convenience of propane.The Grill came in a surprising number of pieces. There was a lot more assembly required then I would have thought. It took my husband a little over an hours to unpack, assemble and dispose of the packaging. So, it was pretty quick. He said the installation was easy and intuitive with good instructions. Now, my husband tends to by very good at putting things together. The installation may take a little longer for most folks.The grill itself was easy to use and did a wonderful job of cooking, although cooking with propane is a little different than cooking with charcoal. (I&#8217;m sure many of you are rolling your eyes and thinking &#8220;DUH&#8221; right now&#8230;.)I have two criticisms about this grill. The first is that the side tables snap up and down, and they are very difficult and latch. This may get easier as they become more worn, but ultimately they feel kind of cheap on what is an otherwise well-made and gorgeous grill. The other criticism is very slight, but the drip pan is a disposable aluminum tray. I wish they would have made a little more effort here and given something a little more sturdy.Overall, we are thus far thrilled with this grill. Everything we have cooked so far has been great and I&#8217;m finding that I don&#8217;t miss the charcoal flavor as much as I thought I would.

You can buy one separately or just use an existing table, or even just place it on concrete if you don't mind bending down to cook, like an old hibachi. The unit uses those little propane cans that are cheapest to purchase at places such as Flowes or Home Desposts. Avoid getting them at supermarkets where the markup can be 3-5x as much for desperate shoppers.There's plenty of heat for cooking frozen chicken, which is usually the toughest thing to cook properly on a portable grill.  However, what I enjoy most is the through the purchase of the griddle unit.  You have to buy it separately but with that, you can easily cook bacon, sausages, eggs, and anything else for breakfast.  I really enjoy this because breakfast is my preferred meal of the day, and the outdoors doesn't get too hot in the early morning.No cons with this unit, except it's so well regarded that it becomes a theft magnet so make sure to cover it up out of sight because even thieves know how great this unit is !

Whether charcoal or gas, you still need a meat thermometer to make sure the right temperture is reached. If your steak is 1/2&#34; thick or less, this gril may cook it to welldone before you can see some browning on the outside due to lower heat (than charcoal). I believe this grill is great for cooking chicken and turkey, as you will need lower heat and extended time.The grill comes almost fully assembled. I only need to attach the handles. I have the tank adapter from another grill, so start cooking with a full tank. No built-in thermometer and drip tray, so that was the reason for 4 stars. You always have to remember to put a drip tray under the grill when cooking, otherwise you have a mess. Most built-in thermometers are inaccurate anyway, but it let you know when your grill reaches the heat level you need.This Weber grill is a great buy. Great looking and design, compact enough for the back of my SUV, perfect for a small patio. I will enjoy this grill for a long time to come. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I have been a weber customer for many years now. I tried other cheaper brands like Char-broil and Char-king, other similar cheap models and have always regretted it. Burners crack and break, the housing rusts through, etc.I have had an older model of the weber Q grill for the past 3 years, it has sat on my deck with a weber cover over it and yes looks great still.I actually got two different weber grills, both reviews are below.--------So now the review for this smaller portable version of the grill. It is made very similar to the larger model except it's about 1/3 the size. The lid is constructed out of the same material, the grates are heavy duty and everything about this grill is just smaller then the larger model.The build quality is excellent. When taking the portable grill out of the box its nearly assembled. All I had to do was put the lid on and attach the handle. Then you slide the grease tray in the bottom, attach your propane and you are ready to go.The grill lights very easily with the built in igniter. Simply turn the gas on, push the igniter button and flame. It cooks evenly and distributes heat well. What I don't like about this small grill is the lack of a thermometer. In the larger \"Q\" grill it includes a thermometer in the lid, this small portable one has lost that feature.All in all it's a great grill, it is built very well, nearly assembled when it arrives, very portable and looks great.  I would recommend this grill if you are looking for a portable one. This grill would get 4 stars.-------The larger model grill with the stand arrived packaged very well and had zero damage. Assembly was fairly easy, however one of the screws refused to go in, it got stock and stripped pretty bad. I saw another reviewer with similar issues so I have to question the quality control of the build.Now, even with one screw not in the grill still sits on the stand pretty solid thanks to the 11 other screws used to hold it together. The stand was \"easy\" to put together, although it sure would have been nice if they had labeled the parts or had you know... words in the directions. I actually installed parts of the stand backwards and didn't realize until after I had it nearly done. The directions are mainly just pictures so I got confused. A little sticker like \"A\" or \"Front\" to help indicate what part is what would be awesome.Now once the stand is assembled the grill pops on easily, you screw it in, attach the lid, the temp gauge and the handle/light and you are ready to cook. The grates are heavy duty, the grill is able to be moved with little trouble and I love it. My old \"Q\" grill similar to this said \"WEBER\" along the top on the lid. This grill is nearly identical but instead of \"WEBER\" it now has the \"Q\" logo printed in the metal.Overall I love this grill, I wish assembly was a bit more clear, but it was easy to resolve my issues.  If you are looking for a outdoor grill the larger model with the stand and collapsible tables is an awesome one, like I said I had an older model on my patio with the basic weber cover over it for years and it still works perfect.

        "reviewText": "Weber Q3200 - PropaneWe've been using a Weber Q200 at our cabin for more than 5 years (there is now a new version Q2200).  It is a handy size for portability & storage.  We bought the optional stand for it which makes it easier & more comfortable to use.  You can cook 6 steaks with room to spare & then pick up the grill & store it away.  The only downside to the Q200 (Q2200)  compared to the bigger Q3200 is that it takes longer to get ripping hot because it has 1 burner vs. 2 burners on the Q3200.  That  makes a difference in preheating time, getting a good sear and maintaining high heat.  But the Q2200 does a really good job if you just adjust your cooking technique to accommodate the lower heating ability.  It also helps to use a 20 gallon propane tank with the smaller grills instead of those little camping LP bottles.  You will also need to purchase a hose & regulator but it's worth it to improve the grilling capability.The Q3200 is quite a step up in grilling quality.  It has a lot more room, 2 burners & attached cart.  We tried it in very cold winter weather & it heated well (just took a bit longer to preheat), it seared well & maintained heat.  It is impressive for a grill this size.  Our steaks were grilled perfectly with excellent caramelizing on the outside & perfectly medium rare on the inside.It took us about 2 hours to unpack & put this Q3200 together.  The directions are very good and easy to follow.  Give yourself plenty of room to spread out the parts and take your time.  It's not complicated.The LED light is actually a nice feature (I was skeptical).  You can turn it to \"auto on\" & the light will go on as you lift the lid, shining light directly on the grilling grates.  As you close the lid, it turns off.  In the fall/winter we often grill when it's dark so this will get a lot of use.  You can also choose to have it off all the time for when you're grilling during the day.This Q3200 grill is not meant to be as portable like the smaller versions of the \"Q\".  It is attached/bolted to the rolling cart (included) & the 20 pound LP tank (not included) is stored/attached to the inside of the cart.  But, if you have a truck & want to tailgate with a bunch of people, this would do the job.The porcelain-enameled, cast iron grates are very nice but I really wish Weber sold a stainless version.  I don't care how careful you are, the cast iron grates are going to flake & rust (yuck).  We BABY our old Q200.  We store it in a heated room, oil the grates every time it gets used, do not use a steel brush or a brass brush, have never left it in the rain/weather & STILL, the porcelain-coated grates started flaking after about 4 years of light use. If we had used a wire grill brush, I'm sure it would have flaked much sooner.  We use a crumpled newspaper with tongs to gently/thoroughly clean our grates.  We don't want little broken brush wires on the grates & then in our food (this happened with a good brass brush we had used on our charcoal grill).  Everything else on our old Q200 grill is perfect; even the stainless burners.  These porcelain-coated grates are the Achilles heel of the Q grills.Yes, you can replace with ANOTHER set of these same grates but you'll have the same problem; ceramic paint flakes on your food!  We have stainless grates for our big gas Weber & our Weber charcoal kettle grills - they are the BEST.  You still get killer grill marks/searing without the concern of flaking grates.  And we have never had to replace them.PLEASE Weber, MANUFACTURE STAINLESS GRATES FOR THE Q LINE!*I emailed Weber & was told the correct protective cover for the Q3200 is: Model #6553 Premium Cover**Update 4/2014:  I ordered & received the \"Model #6553 Premium Cover\" & it fits the Q3200 perfectly with the side tables folded down.**Update 5/28/2014:  I've been using this grill for 4 months now & really like it.  We had a crowd at our cabin for Memorial Weekend & used this grill a lot.  It grills really well.  Gets ripping hot quick & is a good size. TL;DR:",

We have not had to replace grills or burners or any other part for that matter. Our even older model Weber (the big rectangular box style) did really well but we did have to do replace parts on a fairly regular basis. I only mention all of this because this style of Weber lends itself to longevity at a low price.The Weber has about the same cooking surface as our older box model but it takes up less space and less gas to heat up the inside. There are two quick-fold-down tables on either side, plastic and easily wipe-able surface. There are hooks on the table for hanging utensils and grill cleaners. The ignition doesn't fail. It lights quickly. Our four year old model still lights without issues. There are two burner knobs to give you a lot of control over the amount and placement of your heat/flame. The grills clean up about the same as any other grill, with some elbow grease.We've cooked ribs, burgers, steak, fish, veggies, etc all with great results.The tank sits at the back with a plastic mesh cover to hide it. This is actually an issue if it is your custom to turn the gas off at the tank after each use. It is hard to get to it without pulling the grill out to reach the gas knob on the tank.This model has upgraded a couple of little things. There is a rack holder on the front so there is a place to store the warming rack. The built-in light is somewhat useful if you are grilling in the dark. It illuminates enough to see the inside of the grill but it does get in the way sometimes when opening the lid. You can easily remove it and just have the handle.The framework is just about all plastic but I can say that it does not fade or crack. Our older model looks just as new as this newer grill but we also do not move it around a lot. It occasionally gets covered but often is fully exposed to the elements.The grease catcher at the bottom does get a lot of rain water in it, whether the grill is covered or not. This is frustrating because if you don't toss it after every use, it can overflow and get gross.Overall, a great design and perfect grill for most everyday uses. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "Electric barbecuing? Wouldn't it be easier to just cook in your oven? Not necessarily. Grilling can be a very messy affair, and cleaning an outdoor grill is a lot easier than cleaning spattered grease off the wall of your kitchen and range. And cooking outdoors is a great way to cook when you're entertaining in warm weather. Back yard parties are a lot more fun when you don't have to spend most of your time in the kitchen cooking burgers.I've had the LP gas version of this grill for almost four years now, and I've been very pleased with it. The construction is solid, and maintenance is easy. I wondered how an electric grill would compare in ease of use and quality of cooking, so when a review unit became available I requested one. It was about 10 degrees below zero when my unit arrived, so I couldn't test it right away (I could; I just want to!) but a week later it was a toasty 28 degrees so I hauled it on to the back porch and fired it up.That's something you wouldn't do with a gas unit, owing to the fire hazard. An electric grill can still be a fire hazard, but it's a lot safer next to or on a wooden structure than a gas or charcoal unit, as you won't get sparks leaving the grill or open flames. That's a plus. If you're an apartment or condo dweller with an outdoor porch you probably have restrictions regarding having open flames on the porch, but an electric grill is probably okay. And homeowners can use it in their garage i=on rainy days without fear of carbon monoxide poisoning- a real concern with charcoal and gas.Now an electric grill is not going to give you the same flavor as hardwood charcoal, but then, neither will a gas grill. This grill heats up as fast as my charcoal grill and the heat is as even. On the down side, there's only one zone (my gas Weber has two) so it's not as flexible. But it gets just as hot, and you never run out of gas. Electric heat is expensive when you're heating your home, but it's cheap compared to buying propane in 20 lb cans, so that's another plus.I tried cooking burgers in mine, and I can report it does a fine job of that. I also grilled some peppers, onions, tomatoes, and summer squash, and it did a fine job with them, too. It gets how enough that I think my next test might be making pizza in it, if I can find an affordable pizza stone for it. If I do, you'll read about it here. TL;DR:",

I was pleasantly surprised with the Weber 2200. First, it is larger (and heavier) than I expected. Grill/cooking space wise, I couldn't ask for more space for two people. It is sturdy, lights like a full size grill and I love the LED light that lights the surface when the grill top is opened. I honestly have put the grill on my patio full time now and have used it almost exclusively for the past few weeks. I find cleanup easier than the full size and the fat drains off cleanly and efficiently. I may never go back again to the Genesis (unless of course I have a party with many people there). But, if that's the case, I may use the full size for hot dogs and burgers and use the 2200 for kabobs (fire them both up). I love it!!! TL;DR:",

I really like the fold out side trays, and the fact that everything folds in on itself very neatly for portability.  For this grill, I felt like it's strength was also a bit of con - it is so well built and sturdy, that it is almost too heavy to carry around.  Perhaps putting wheels on one end and making it where you could tilt it up and wheel it around would have been better.  In spite of it's weight, I still really love it and think it deserves 5 stars because it is so solid (nice thick lid, and sturdy thick grates) that it will likely last longer than me.  I don't expect I'll ever need to buy another camping grill.

It may have a plug, but this is no dressed up griddle.  It is a grill and does what grills do.BUILDI have a Weber charcoal grill, and found the quality substantially better than most common brands.  The same applies to this portable size.  Everything is heavy duty and has a premium look.  The hinge is sturdy and should last for years without issue, and the lid could take a heavy beating without losing functionality.The grill surface is the same heavy porcelain-enameled cast iron that I have enjoyed on the bigger grill, which holds heat well and is easy to clean.  Speaking of that, a thorough cleaning is not too difficult and the drip pan uses the standard size, which means that you can buy disposable liners if you wish.FUNCTIONIt is a very strange feeling to warm up a grill without a charcoal chimney or tank of propane.  Instead, it only requires being plugged in for 20 minutes with the lid closed.  Make sure that your outdoor outlet can handle the 1560 Watt draw, which is similar to a space heater on high.  A standard circuit should be fine as long as nothing else (garden tools, etc.) is on it.  If you are going to break the rules and use an extension cord, make sure it is properly rated for the job.Adjusting the heat requires no airflow management.  Instead, it is all handled by twisting the knob.  Bring your own thermometer if you doubt the guidelines in the book, since one is not built into the lid.The moment of truth came when I dropped my first animal product onto the grill.  To my manly delight, it sizzled and smoked just like any other grill.  It also made beautiful grill marks.  I also was able to use wood chips similar to a propane grill to add some flavor.  The food was delicious, with a clean flavor unique to this type of grill, but still a distinctly &#34;grilled&#34; flavor.  I was worried, but it was able to stay very hot despite it being cold outside.SUMMARYThe rituals of grilling, particularly with charcoal, are absent with this unit, but beyond that psychological barrier, it delivers proper grilled food.  As with other Weber products, it is superior in durability and grill surface.  The only significant change I would prefer is a built-in thermometer. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "First off, I'm happy to see Weber putting forward a new version of this grill and not getting complacent.  I own the predecessor Q200/Q220 grill, so this review will compare the old to the new.The majority of this grill comes pre-assembled.  The parts you have to put together are trivial.  Weber also conveniently includes a disposable aluminum liner pan so your permanent aluminum pan doesn't have to be washed.  Nice!  Weber's manual is straight forward and gets you going quick.  Per the manual, make sure you check for leaks after you connect the gas just to be safe.  Besides the manual, you get a water resistant Grilling Guide that has common grilling tips on the front an approximate grilling time chart on the back for different types of meat.  Do yourself a favor though and get an instant read thermometer so you can grill based on meat temperature instead of solely on time.  Both the manual and the guide come in English, Spanish, and French Canadian.This grill is perfect when grilling for 4-6 people, maybe even up to the 8.  If you commonly grill for 1-4 people, consider getting the next size smaller to save on gas.  For my tests, I connected a 5LB gas canister using a non-Weber adapter hose which is done for convenience by me and many other people.  The manual says to use either 14.1oz or 16.4oz cylinders, and does not explicitly address the subject of using an adapter hose with larger tanks.  However Weber does sell a Q Adapter Hose for use with 20lbs tanks so that might suggest how they feel about the matter.The porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates felt rock solid and are easy to clean.  Having a split grate, which is a new feature, makes it easier to pull them off to clean but also gives you the option to get a griddle for one side.  Honestly, I'd rather just bring a cast iron skillet with me instead of messing with a messy griddle.  Weber's griddle pictures, by the way, show shrimp being grilled on a griddle but I've also done shrimp on the grate and they come out amazing.While grilling, I tested for hot spots but didn't find anything obvious.  However, certainly some of the hot dogs I made were cooked more so than others so there are definitely hot spots.  Most seemed near the flames oval on the right and left side.  One missing feature from this grill is the ability to have more than one zone.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to have temperature knob for the left and right side as well as the ability to turn off one side completely.The fold-out trays are a must-have and feel sturdy.  For some strange reason though Weber removed the grilling tool hangers that were found on the previous model.  Also gone is the 'underbar' that is under either the left or right tray.  This could be used to hold grilling tools when folding the tray into the grill.The temperature gauge is nice to have but generally I don't trust the style built into grills as they can easily be off 25-50F.  I just use it as a point of reference.  Incidentally, the temperate gauge is now more oval and has a slightly different display.  The ignition button works like a champ, and Weber includes a battery (for Q2200) showing once again they think about even small details.The gas control knob is big and easily readable, however, I do not like how easy it is to go from on to off.  The previous model had more resistance and a better feedback \"click\" as to when you hit on and off.  This is probably the biggest disappointment of this new grill, but certainly I can adapt to the new knob.  And that reminds me to mention the following: always disconnect the gas canister when transporting portable grills in the car.Also, some unexpected good news.  This gill fits on the previous generation cart!  But I must say that the new collapsible cart looks superior -- I've never really like old collapsible one due to how cumbersome it was to fold them up.All in all, I rate this grill 4.5 out of 5 but I'm rounding up due to Weber's reliability, quality, and how they think about a lot of small details.

I am really happy about the grease pan, much nicer then a cup, it is a small rectangular pan which can be easily discarded and replaced.  3 things though.  1, the wheel axle connectors were slightly different, one thicker than the other.  Went on fine but confused as to why this is.  Nothing in instructions about it.  2, there is a removable piece of plastic on handle that has a picture of a plug.  I have no idea what it is for.  It says it is a logo.  My only thought is that the handles are generic and they snap the logos in.  I will check next time I see a propane one in store.  3, I had a scare, got the whole thing together and no grates, I looked everywhere and could not find them.  Lifted box and it was HEAVY.  The grates were under a false bottom in cardboard.  So take everything out of box when assembling.  It's pouring rain so I can't use it yet, will get back with cooking results.  I got around to cooking on it last night, a burger and it came out great.  I had a Foreman previously and it did not get hot enough to give a good sear in my estimation, the Weber is perfect.

Since football season is over, I tried it out on a camping trip. It dos come in a few pieces, but it took less than twenty minutes to put everything together out of the box. It heats up quickly and evenly right through my car's cigarette adapter. The coating on the grill is not non-stick, but handled hot dogs, vegetables, and fish very well with minimal sticking, and was easy to clean. This is a big plus when I'm out in the woods with little access to cleaning supplies. Actual cooking was handled very well, and surprisingly, I was even able to get a nice sear from it, which I wasn't expecting from an electric model. I ended up getting the Weber 6549 Weber Q Rolling Cart, which is a huge plus and I really recommend using it with any of the Weber Grill models. It makes a big difference with the portability of the grill, and I think it will especially be useful for tailgating. TL;DR:",

The hardest part of the set-up--no real \"assembly\" is required, other than putting on the \"wings\"--was finding the appropriate propane cylinder in the dead of winter locally. Once that was accomplished, and the cylinder screwed in, the unit started with just a few pops of the ignitor and heated up quite quickly.We cooked burgers and chicken breasts for our test run and both turned out just as well as on our full-size Weber. The surface area is plenty large for 4-6 of each, and we easily fit 4 burgers and 2, smallish breasts on at a time, and it was a perfectly usable height on top of a granite picnic. After cool down the unit was fairly easy to clean and seems perfect for an RV, boat, tailgating (our likely use scenario) or just any small space use-case (apartment, second home). Also useful to have on hand if you're normally a charcoal griller, but occasionally want a quick, gas grill backup.All in all, I was impressed by the power this compact unit provided. It's a high-quality grilling experience in a small package, offering the convenience of a gas grill without the usual, bulky footprint. It also seems to built to last, versus less expensive, but also far less sturdy, portable options. TL;DR:",

We use a Weber Genesis E330 in our home and a Weber Q200 for our frequent tailgating activities.  We have used the Genesis for two years with excellent results.  We have had two minor issues with the Genesis and WEBER Customer Service responded immediately and rapidly without any hassles whatsoever.  We have used the Q200 for almost TEN (10) years with outstanding results.  It is, without question, the best &#34;portable&#34; grill money can buy.  So, recently, when we wanted a grill for a high rise condominium balcony which prohibits propane, we immediately turned to Weber.  We decided to order the Q1400 Electric.  Right out of the box we were impressed with the rich appearance and full assembly.  The cord is relatively short (6 foot), but this is understandable for safety reasons.  We wish we would have ordered the optional cart, but a sturdy tempered glass top table served to elevate the grill to a comfortable level for cooking.  Our first meal on the new Q1400 was filet and lobster tail.  We were a bit apprehensive about the performance of the electric grill since we are accustomed to grilling on propane.  However, the Q1400 heated quickly and cooked effectively and evenly.  We could tell little difference between cooking with the electric element versus propane.  Our meal was outstanding.  We are pleased to have found the perfect solution for grilling on a condominium balcony which prohibits propane.  The ONLY negative we can offer is the fact that WEBER has long prided themselves on manufacturing their products in the USA.  This particular model is NOT manufactured in the USA.  We were disappointed to learn this as we support American manufacturing whenever possible.  With regards to all other respects of the product, we highly recommend the Weber Q1400. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I have owned a large Q300 for years. This review is for BOTH the Q1200 and somewhat larger Q2200, just smaller versions and without the stand or 20 pound propane cylinder.  The Q1200 and Q2200 are identical other than a somewhat smaller size with one over the other. I would recommend you buy the optional Weber Q Adapter Hose and a 20 pound Propane tank for either. Mine last a year with a LOT of use on our larger Q300 model and you will save a fortune on the disposable, portable, VERY expensive litle cylinders. Even if traveling I would use the 20 pound tank, it simply just works best for us.So why do I need 3 grills anyway? Well I recently have lost the use of my legs and even with leg braces, sometimes can't even stand, much less walk.  So what may seem extravagant at first, is really not at all. The Q300 on it's factory stand is now just too tall if in my wheelchair or Mobility Scooter the wife just bought me for Christmas. It is a Pride Victory Sport 4 wheel model and I am able to swivel the seat to face to ANY direction.  I use the Q2200 on the front patio concrete table (nice and LOW for me and drive right up to it, swivel my seat directly to the grill and off I go.  SO easy and I still get to participate, not just mope around feeling useless... I bought a cheapo dolly on wheels to carry the extra 20 pound propane cylinder we bought since the one in the big Q300 is a nightmare (for ME) to take in and out each time if switching grills. The Q300 is for when family or neighbors come over then THEY get to do the cooking and work!So why that dolly with wheels for the 2 smaller grills? Well I have a large hot tub out in the back yard and instead of moving ALL the stuff if I want to cook at the hot tub I simply bought a cheap little table (LOW!) next to that tub. I hook my dolly/cart and pull it like a trailer with that 20 pound propane (extra tank), simply connect 1 line end to the Q1200 and off I go. If not disabled I know it may not make good sense? But for ME? It is like getting a little piece of my life back. I am not buying covers for these smaller grills since my large one on the Q300 has the top just about rotted off from sun damage. I now place a towel over the top of that cover and should have thought about that years ago. The 2 smaller grills seem to be made of exact same materials and I see no reason to even bother covering but will just fit a small piece of plastic tarp over them if it EVER rains here in Southern California! (Camp Pendleton area). We have had weather in the 80's all this month of January....There really is no assembly to speak of compared to the nightmare I had with the Q300.  In fairness, I suppose it wasn't all that hard either but with the stand and at that time I was just beginning to fight with disability, it kinda kicked my behind. I did have a problem with the Q2200 with the igniter electrode assembly. Could not get that sucker to spark!  It would light with a match but no other way. My Q300 has NEVER missed a beat so I called customer service. If you ever have to do so, be prepared for a shock. An American IN America will answer the phone, speak perfect English and be very helpful! I know, it seems like a likely story right. Even I thought maybe it was the pain medication:-)  Long story short, the woman was SUPER nice and said she would RUSH a new igniter electrode assembly. I went back and did the assembly of the other Weber and it worked fine. So I keep tinkering with this and found a wire not properly seated. I checked that prior for what seemed like a dozen time but guess I air headed it and flat missed it or who knows what. I called back l later to explain I did NOT need that part but it was already \"processed\". I told her I would ship it back at my expense and she told me to keep it for a spare! So America IS still alive and well. At least with some companies anyway. I will continue to be a Weber customer for life as I have been all along.I normally never give a 5 star rating right off the bat for ANY product. I have written hundreds of reviews and don't believe in going on some honeymoon rant about how amazing a product is in the first 10 minutes of use, have it burst into flames or fall apart in a hundred pieces then never go back to correct that review. But this product is different. It is essentially (BOTH the Q1200 and Q2200) just junior versions of my old and trusty Q300. I couldn't ask for more. It has served me well, the company has proven itself to me to be simply amazing at caring for it's customers AFTER sale. I would give 10 stars if I could. Weber has earned that from me and done it the old fashioned way. With quality products, and quality service.I would end with only this. If you are not disabled you may want to consider their optional stand? If not, at least just remember to NOT set it on something that may melt or catch fire:-) Trust me, I have accidentally grilled a couple really nice plastic tables UNDER my grill in my time....My concrete table work just great for me now however.

        "reviewText": "Dare I say it?  Well, I will say it again, PERFECTION!  I was a bit skeptical at the ability of an electric grill being able to perform as a propane or charcoal grill could but I have eaten my doubt and words.Product arrives in a big box but is actually rather compact; this is because there is no base for the grill to sit on.  That base cart can be purchased as an accessory.  I have always taken issue with the fact that Weber makes you purchase this cart separately.  For a little bit more they should just include it with your original purchase.I wish that we could have used this grill outside but since we have been dealing with the &#34;POLAR VORTEX&#34; for the last month there has never been a warm or dry enough day to sit on the balcony grilling while dreaming of a NY steamy summer.  We opted to grill inside and I will be the first to warn you against doing this UNLESS you have previously done this and understand that there will be a lot of smoke and you will have the smell of street cart vendor stuck to everything on your body!  We set up an air machine, ceiling fan and opened a few windows on this frigid day (21 degrees) and grilled.  There was the mandatory 20 min pre-heat prep for proper searing and temperature regulation.  This wasn't an issue as I took the time to prepare our meal and prep the pork belly and pork chops.The grill heats up quickly and evenly.  I assumed that the metal dome top would steam everything rather than provide a true sear to anything.  I was extremely surprised when all the chops including the pork belly came out beautifully seared and the fat on the pork belly was perfectly charred to our liking.  It was so QUICK!!  Honestly it was quicker than our infrared propane grill on the balcony that we use during the summer.  You have to keep the lid down and this effectively cooks everything quickly and provides the right amount of heat combined with the awesome grates.A tiny issue is that cooking surface is a bit small.  We had to cook everything in 3 batches.  Again, the grill is super quick!  There were two pork bellies and 2 odd shaped chops that would fit at a time.  If you need a better example: Imagine 6 center cut boneless chops; that is what you can grill at one time on the small surface.  Depending on what we are preparing it is not enough space for a family of five.Clean-up is pretty simple and straight-forward.  The grates soak in the sink and then can be wiped clean with your sponge.  You will not need any scouring pads or harsh barbecue brushes.  The bottom bowl located beneath the heating element that catches all the grease/juices is also simple to clean.  Pop out and wash.  This has been the easiest grill we have ever had to clean.Highly recommend for apartment dwellers that are not allowed because of board rules, landlords or city regulations to have a gas or charcoal grill on their patio, balcony or outdoor space.  This item was made for big cities and any New Yorker would love one.  At first I balked at the price thinking that it would be exactly like a George Foreman, but after trying it out I truly believe that it is worth every penny.  I just wish that they would include the cart.  We simply placed it on top of our washer/dryer.  It was smoky but it is even that way when we grill outside on our balcony.  I would also recommend for the consumer that does not want to deal with charcoal or the constant change of propane tanks.  This is as simple as it can get and your family or guests will most likely not be able to tell the difference. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I should start by saying that I am generally very resistant to using any soil product with fertilizer included because I garden organically (at least outdoors) and have never had any problem getting vegetables or flowers to grow without any fertilizers. Forests grow pretty well on their own with only nature's own fertilizer: the compost of decaying biological matter.That said, I will use fertilizers (I use liquid Miracle Grow primarily) for houseplants (as long as they are not producing vegetables or fruit) because a) I'm not eating them and b) it's hard to create a good composting environment indoors. There is no question that a good liquid fertilizer helps indoor plants *if* you use it regularly. A time-released pellet form is actually better because it avoids the feast-or-famine cycle that is created with liquid fertilizers (particularly if you're not consistent when it comes to feeding).I mention all of this because this soil also includes fertilizer--and that is my only complaint. As far as being a good moisture-retention soil, it does, in fact, work quite well--particularly in smaller pots that dry out faster. I live in New England and the only windows that get enough light in winter to grow certain types of plants are south-facing and even in the dead of winter, that light can get very hot. Also, with the hot-air furnace cranking, plants dry out super fast. So I took four plants (two clivia miniata plants, an avocado that hasn't fruited yet, and a Christmas cactus) and repotted them with this Miracle Grow mix and i would say that, roughly, it has doubled the time between waterings--and that does save me a lot of trouble and it saves the plants a lot of stress if I forget to water. The primary water-retaining agent, by the way, is just sphagnum peat, which you can buy separately and add to any potting soil. There is also an unspecified \"wetting agent\" included in this soil.I really wish that Miracle Grow (Scott's) would make a non-fertilized version of this because I also grow indoor fruit like Meyer lemons and I eat those--and would prefer to grow them organically.So, yes, works great for house plants, particularly flowers, so that's why it's getting four stars. It will do your houseplants a lot of good.  I just don't understand this need to add fertilizer to everything--have you tried to buy soil without it lately?

I find it never had a lot of sticks in it- though like other potting soils it always seems to be better to buy in the spring than later in the year towards the fall.  Later bags tend to have bigger 'chunks' in them for some reason.I like it enough to buy about a bag a week.  In early spring I can often find better prices than this in the big box stores, but not always.  The least I've seen it for is $7 on sale, but it often runs around 10-12 for 2 cubic feet, so I might as well buy it on Amazon and have it delivered and save the gas.  It's really a LOT easier on my back this way.It has a lot of peat in it which absorbs water keeping the mix damp longer.  When starting seeds, it is just very important to get the seed tray good and wet the first time after you start them, but then monitor them closely and don't over water - if you do the seeds can just rot instead of sprouting, but that first good watering is needed to soften up the seed shells.Sometimes if I have another mix, I will use it on the bottom and then this on TOP of my pots.  That still helps keep water in.I've started tons of seeds in this in my greenhouse- they don't have a hard time at all pushing up through it because it's a finer mix than some, and it helps give seedlings the moisture they need so they don't dry out until they get some size and their second leaves.I've not had any problems with weeds coming up in it or anything either, like I have some cheaper brands.  Only stuff that comes up is what I plant.The bags are a pretty thick plastic too, and I've never had one arrive busted.

At about an inch-and-a-half tall I put the seedlings in larger containers. The top couple inches of soil is a 50/50 mix of the starter mix and this potting mix for more fertilizer and extra water retention, since seedlings are so sensitive to drying out. This potting mix has .21 - .11 P - .16 NPK, polymer-coated for slow release over a few months. (The starter mix has very little fertilizer, to keep from burning new roots.) Below that 50/50 mix I putMiracle-Gro Garden Soil for Flower and Vegetable, since we don't plant tomatoes outside here until June, and it will set the roots in something more suitable for outdoors.They're doing great in that mixture, with more than twice as much leaf growth as seedlings in the local nursery medium in the same size containers. (When they go into the ground outside they'll get less nitrogen in the fertilizer. Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)This mix looks like slightly dark sphagnum peat moss, the main listed ingredient, with few twigs, and just a bit of perlite. The package says it may also include, as the second listed ingredient, processed forest products, peat and/or compost. It also contains coir (coconut husk fibers) and a wetting agent (to help soak in water), along with the fertilizer listed above. TL;DR:",

Assembled, the feeder stands approximately 8&#8221; high and is 8.5&#8221; in diameter. The plastic bottle has a capacity of approximately 20 fluid ounces. Empty, the feeder weighs under 2 ounces. The base plate includes a outer edge that birds can use for toe holds, and 3 holes on the outer edge that could accommodate a hanging chain or twine (shown in the product photo, but NOT included). The feeder is designed so that the plastic bottle can be replaced with a jelly jar (2.25&#8221; diameter, slightly smaller than standard home canning jelly jars).I was thoroughly unimpressed with the quality of this feeder, starting with the fact that no chain or other hanging implement was included in the package. It is up to you to find a way to hang the feeder, either that, or you will need to set the feeder on a ledge or table. In general, orioles do like fruit, especially oranges, so this feeder might be attractive if you've got orioles in your neighborhood.

It is solely a jelly feeder, so you'll need to hope that the orioles around your home enjoy jelly. Mine prefer nectar (sugar water). I did observe a hooded oriole come to this feeder once after I hung it, and it hung untouched after that. The feeder allows you to fill up the plastic jar that comes with it and then screw it directly into the feeder; a handle underneath connects to a blade that pushes into the jar that, when the handle is turned, pushes the jelly down into the surrounding tray. This way you can keep dispensing the jelly as it gets eaten. You can also attach a standard-sized jelly jar and it'll fit fine. One issue I noticed is that if too much jelly dispenses it can be easy for the jelly to spill if it is windy.Overall this is a good feeder, it just didn't work well for me because my local orioles don't seem to like jelly much.

Our experience has been similar in terms of the number of species.  His feeder is essentially a hanging dish, and he puts jelly in it every morning.  This one accepts a jar, and you just turn a handle on the bottom to feed more jelly -- at least that's the theory.  Maybe it's the brand of jelly we are using, but it isn't quite that easy.  The jelly isn't fluid enough and tends not to just run down, plus cleanup is not as easy as our friend's open style.  Of course we could just leave the jar off and put the jelly in each morning.

But my lack of DIY building skills -- particularly when it comes to making square corners with pieces of wood -- made the project seem too intimidating and I kept putting it off. All winter I thought about the raised bed I wanted and was thrilled to get these.These corners allow me to build the raised bed I want without having to worry about whether I could make square corners because the 2 by (6, 8 or 10) boards fit into the channels in the corners.  There are little flanges (the manufacturer calls them levers, but they don't move) that keep the boards in place.  It can take some adjusting the wood into place with a mallet, but the corners will be square!If you have to worry about frost heave, as I do in Minnesota, there are 4 holes in the bottom of each corner so you can put screws (or corner brackets) in to really hold the wood in place.  You may also want to put screws in the upper corner joints, especially if you use 2 by 10 boards, to keep the upper edges to stay together after you fill the garden bed with soil.  The good news for people like me is that the boards are already secure so you don't need to worry about the corners going out of square while the extra screws go in!The corners are 6 inches tall so they will look prettier if you use 2x6 or maybe even 2x8 boards.  But I wanted a deeper garden bed so I used 2x10s.  It isn't as aesthetically nice as with a smaller board, but practicality won out.

I have trouble pulling weeds because I don&#8217;t really know the difference between a weed and a plant, especially when I am not the one who planted it. I do have a patch of dirt in the backyard with nothing there, and I thought a basic garden bed would work there and maybe I might like just putting things in there and hoping it will turn into something nice.  It turns out I have a shaded area so I need to be choosy with what I put there, but fortunately getting the bed up was not an issue.  Others are right, additional anchors were needed, but the corners look very nice and setting up was not a big issue at all. I would readily get this for someone, not only because it&#8217;s easy but this specific kit allows that person to basically design their own size, within limits. This would not be ideal for say a very large community garden. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The AeroGarden arrived in very good condition and was easy to put together.  I had to double check the instructions to make sure I was getting the water and nutrients into the tank correctly.  The pods are already planted with seeds so that makes it easier not having to deal with very tiny seeds.  The label needs to stay on the top of each pod because it assists with moisture control.  The label also gives the name of the plant(s), it's expected germination time, and it's height.  As the instructions recommend, it is better to place shorter plants in front; the taller ones to the outsides and middle back.  Placement is much more critical with taller vegetables than herbs which will be used earlier and kept trimmed more regularly than a tomato for example.  I'm at day 12; the plants are all now sprouted and above the label.  The clear caps are off all but two that have just made it above the label this morning.  The caps come off when the plant is touching the top.  The caps help maintain a more humid and warm environment during the germination phase.  There is a recommendation in the instructions to remove surplus plants within each pod which I have yet to do.  Each basil has 5 to 6 plants; the mint is very tiny.  Since it is just getting above the label it's hard to count plants yet.  It looks like the parsley and chives have more seeds sprouting down below the label but it might be a couple days before I can be sure.The two types of basil are ready for their first trimming below the initial leaves to stimulate side growth.  It has been really fun to check it every morning to see what is new.  I grew up on a farm/ranch and have lots of experience growing everything from vegetables to fruit trees.  But, that was in the past, in a different place which is what makes this, sitting near my kitchen, all that much more fun to do it again.Pods are available pre-seeded with vegetables and flowers, or as a kit to put together with one's own seeds.  The lights do stay on for 17 hours each day.  They are pre-programmed on their own timer.  At least that's the way this model works.  There are smaller, less computerized models available, but they all use grow lights.  The grow lights do need to be replaced on a regular basis.  The lights are not expensive.  The computer unit keeps a daily countdown of days until nutrients need to be put into the water, and the water refilled to it's correct level.  There is also a recommended schedule of cleaning the water tank and replacing the water and nutrients.  This is a pretty well thought-out product providing a lot of fun, resulting in a crop of herbs, vegetables, or flowers. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "[I bought this garden directly from the website since it was not on Amazon at the time.]Lights - The lights are a nice upgrade if you have an AeroGarden 7. The AeroGarden 7 only has two lights, this Ultra garden has three. I did notice though that the lights in the Ultra sometimes flicker, I'm not sure why. Maybe I have bad bulbs, I did notice on the website some people reporting that the light goes well before it's time. You're covered for six months on the bulb, I would suggest getting extra in case something happens though.The heat from the bulb is pretty warm too. If your seedlings are sensitive to heat then the heat from the bulbs could actually burn them. I have pepper seedlings in mine and they seem to be doing great right now.Pump - Unlike the AeroGarden 7 which has an air stone the Ultra has a water pump and no air stone. If you wanted to the Ultra has two holes which can feed an air line, you would also need to buy an air stone too. It looks like it would take a normal size air line, I am not completely sure however. So far I have no problems with the pump, they sell replacement pumps on the website if you need to replace it. If you have an air stone in the system when pump goes then you don't need to worry too much about rushing it because the air stone will provide enough air to keep them alive. Remember, the AeroGarden 7 does not have a pump just an air stone.The pump also pumps out water on the side of the sponges too.Digital Stuff - My biggest problem is here. They didn't put much testing into this. The way some stuff is written it seems like it was written in another language then translated. Also, when the power goes out you will lose some data such as the nutrient cycle. When my power went out the nutrient cycle completely reset, so even if the water is bare of any nutrients the system will not tell you to add any because of this. I don't see anyway to change it back so now I need to rely on a PPM meter all the time. You can get this meter from amazon. They claimed they fixed this issue but apparently they didn't.The LCD light is so bright too! There is no way to turn it down or off. I have it in my room so I have to put a sock or something over it at night just to sleep.The Ultra also allow you to use custom settings. I don't think I will ever use them. Could be fun to try new things with it though.Design - The design looks nice, it don't take up much room. It's about 15 inches long and 11 inches wide. The plug that goes into the light does not go in all the way. I think they made the plugin part too long. It don't bother me too much but it would look nicer if it actually fit correctly. This system should also be easy for you to clean compared to the AeroGarden 7.Seed Kit - Mine came with a pepper seed kit, the one on Amazon comes with an herb seed kit. With the pepper seed kit you can only grow two plants, which is kinda silly because the AeroGarden 7 is smaller and allows you to grow 3 tomato plants. I would think pepper plants would be less in a bigger container? Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't really like how the AeroGarden seed kits only come with so many. I could fit another tomato plant inside the AeroGarden 7, giving me 4 plants instead of three. As long as you manage the size good you will do great.I had an herb kit planted in the AeroGarden 7 before I switched it to tomatoes and all the herbs did good.Nutrients - The Ultra comes with the nutrients in a squeezable bottle, which is nice. It worked ok for my cherry tomatoes in the AeroGarden 7 when it came with them. The only problem I have is you get little clumps of buildup from it which would mean more cleaning of the pump. If you're not worried about the organic label then try using general hydroponics flora series (they cannot be labeled as organic because they use machines something). It's $40 for all three needed but should last you multiple grows unlike the small bottle they give you. It does a lot better too, gives the most amazing taste to what you grow. You could also invest in a PH kit by general hydroponics too if you wish to go that far. I would keep PH around 5.5-6.0.Water - They tell you not use use well water, which is true. Well water can wreck the system. You should only use RO water or distilled water. I do have one problem with what they say though. Not every RO system is equal... some are better than others. It all depends on how the water is filtered. AeroGarden tells you not to use RO well water either if it's been softened. I don't know why but there shouldn't be a problem. My RO system produces near \"distilled\" water, and it adds some nutrients to it (such as calcium) in the last cycle so it's better to drink. Chances are if you have a at least 3-4 stage RO system then you can use it. My system is a 6-stage by iSpring for those of you that wish to know, I got it right from Amazon.Overall - This garden does have it's problems, the nutrient cycle is the biggest for me because now I have to keep testing with my PPM meter until the cycle is normal again. For an average person this could cause them to lose their plants if the water ran bare of nutrients due to this. It's best to have a PPM meter on hand because the cycle WILL mess up on you, you cannot avoid it. For seedlings you can keep the PPM around 400-600. For plants over 12 inches you can keep it at around 800-1000, but I wouldn't let it drop below 600.Would I say it's worth $250? No, not at all. With the price I paid (A little over 1/3 of the price of a smartphone priced at $700) I would want this to be in great working condition. Until they have digital problems, and lights sorted out I would stick with the AeroGarden 7 which is about $100 cheaper. They only have two seed kits made for the taller garden like the Ultra anyway, you're not missing out on much unless you want to grow bell peppers, or mega cherry tomatoes. You can still grow the smaller stuff however, so don't get confused on that. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I'm going to make this an ongoing review, simply because it may take some time before I can verify if the AeroGarden Ultra really works.Review 1 - The AeroGarden is a decent size and is able to hold 7 seed pods. What comes with the AeroGarden is an Herb mix, stuff like Dill, Chives and Mint. I was kind of hoping for something like Strawberries or peppers, something tangible, but the herbs are a good first run.Set-up was fairly easy, simply pull all of the pieces out of the box, snap the light bulbs into place, then secure the lamp to the base, plug in the unit and you're done. Very easy.The next part was very, very cool. There is a little blue light up screen on the front of the AeroGarden, and when you start your garden you hit a button marked \"Quick Plant\". This walks you through, step by step, the planting, feeding and watering process, as well as allowing you to set the light timer. This screen will also alert you when it's time to replenish the plant nutrients and other important info.So basically we follow the steps outlined, fill the base with water to the \"fill line\", add nutrients and finally insert the seed pods into the available slots. That's it, all very easy, and kind of fun.Now I will say that you should have a place to set up your AeroGarden. While not very large, it's still about the same footprint of a microwave oven, and will need plenty of space to \"grow\" as the lamp must rise as your plants grow. We initially set the unit up in my daughter's room as she really wanted to be the one to run the AeroGarden, which was fine, until we realized that the AeroGarden's lamps must remain on for about 17 hours of the day, and WOW...those lights are BRIGHT! No way she could sleep with these bulbs burning!! So we set the unit up in our dining room. (The good new is that if we have to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, the blaring light from the AeroGarden shines over the entire first floor!!)I will follow up this review when I see some growth, it looks like most everything in the kit should bloom between 5-7 days.Review # 2 - Well we have sprouts!! About half the pods are showing growth, so that's pretty cool. I do have some reservations about the product, specifically...just how much power is this thing using??? The grow lights are simply BRIGHT...and they have to remain for so long! I can imagine my power meter just ticking away like a stopwatch. But we are having fun watching these things begin to pop up, and the unit is working as advertised. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "NOTE: Before deciding to buy this model, look at the just-announced LED version that AeroGarden (AG) claims to be a major improvement: More effective lighting and cheaper over time. Although the LED version lists for $100 more than the fluorescent light version, the fluorescent lights are a major expense. The fluorescent lights list at $35 (as a set of 3) and need to be replaced every six months -- comments on the AG website indicate that these lights often *burn out* around 6-8 months, not just that they become less effective. The LED version is advertised to last 3-5 years, or $210-350 worth of fluorescent bulbs. And the operating cost is less. Other than the LED lighting, that model seems the same as this one. However, see the comments below about (poor) quality of construction -- the LED model might not survive long enough to reap the benefits.Limited review: I was given this product in exchange for an honest timely review. The time limit requires me to post this review well before I have had the experience of a full cycle of growing plants. I am commenting on my early experience and will update this review as appropriate.Because of my professional background, I tend to be much more critical in my evaluations of products. You may well decide that various of my comments are irrelevant/unimportant to you, so I have tried to structure this to make it easier for you to spot and skip such comments.Details: As an engineer (software) I not only developed products but dealt with the company's marketing people about design decisions. And another part of my job was evaluating products, both competitive analysis and for purchasing decisions. One lesson-learned from dealing with Product Managers (Marketing) was to play close attention to their visible decisions because they are highly predictive of decisions that you don't immediately spot.----My first negative reaction came with unpacking the product -- it felt too insubstantial for what it was. It was not just me. I asked several neighbors to give me their quick first impression (no hints) and the responses were \"cheesy\", \"flimsy\", \"cheap\" and not built to last. However, in looking through various comments, I couldn't find complaints about this being a problem, so maybe it is tougher than it looks, or maybe people adapted.First, the plastic could easily have been a bit thicker in both the tank and the hood. Second, the pole for holding up the hood is probably more than strong-enough, but the impression was \"cheap\". The cutting-corners was evident in that AG didn't even bother to de-burr (smooth off) the rough ends of the pole. But most worrisome is that the sockets for the pole in both the base and hood are relatively thin-walled -- I would have thought they needed to be much thicker to handle the torque of even a partially raised hood.Note: I don't know how the construction of this model compares to earlier one (for you to extrapolate from the reviews of those models), but the taller (extensible) pole is an advantage for growing taller plants, but creates torque greater than those models. And the hood carries more weight from an additional bulb (3 vs 2 in the previous model).Because I know to be very careful about this, I expect that I can keep it from breaking prematurely. However, if you plan to let children help you, there may be a problem. And if you have a cat, you may have a problem: I couldn't use the initial place I planned to put the unit because I knew that my cat would be rubbing against it (curiosity and scent-marking). And I think it would be the height of folly to grow catnip in this unit (one of the seed kits that AG sells).The biggest example of corner-cutting and unimaginably bad design is the trellis. This is thin cheap plastic bar that seems to be capable of *guiding* the growth of plants, but not supporting plants such as tomatoes, much less supporting tomato plants while you are picking. The trellis was not designed for reuse from season to season: Connecting the two halves is permanent, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood it will be broken during storage. Although I don't see this being a significant factor itself in your buying decision, this is indicative of the pervasive problems with this product.----One of the basics of Marketing is to do multiple things to make your customers happy with their purchase. If this were not a review unit, I would have had significant buyer's remorse.1. The cost and frequency of replacement lighting was a major surprise (see above). Having used straight fluorescent grow-light tubes, I expected an operating life of 2-3 times these, and a lower price.2. The need to immediately buy supplemental items. For example, I hadn't considered the need to change the water in the tank. I judge it impractical to carry the tank to the sink, because of (1) the lack of grips suitable to the weight, with the risk of both spilling the water and of breaking the tank, (2) no good way of leaving the growing plants behind (at my location for the product). So the alternative is to siphon out the water into a bucket -- not great in several regards, but the lesser evil. And surprise, AG sells a siphon pump separately, but you can likely get one from a fish/aquarium store.3. Badly over-priced supplies. For example, paper labels for the pods cost $0.26 each (in bulk = 50 count). For comparison, file folder labels cost less than $0.04. The pod baskets which are trivial pieces of plastic cost $0.34 each (in bulk). The plug for unused holes is a combination of these two and is further marked up to $1.33 each (from $0.60). Furthermore, this is the wrong way to plug the holes -- the plugs should have been a more robust construction and should have been included, not an after-market purchase. Then there are the \"Grow Domes\" which are essentially the little plastic cups you put Salsa in at Mexican take-out: $0.30 each (in bulk).Advice: Before making a purchase, look at the price of supplies and decide if you are going to feel that you are being gouged. If so, that is likely to adversely affect your use or enjoyment of this product.4. Difficulty find a location for the unit. You are instructed to *not* locate this product where the plants will get sunlight because that can overwhelm them. This eliminated most of my prime locations for this unit. I was surprised that the product couldn't handle this. Then eliminate locations where draining and refilling the tank will be a problem. Then ... From what I have figured out, the product was designed on the assumption that you would find a location suitable for its requirements, rather than being designed to be adaptable to where you wanted to put it.Note: One can adjust either the starting time or ending time for the lights, but not both. Setting one automatically resets the other to have a fixed period the lights are on. I wanted to put the unit in a south-facing garden window and set the start-time to be roughly sunset, with a 6-hour runtime to supplement the natural light. You can't do this. The closest approximation I found is to disconnect the unit's lights and leave the windows lights on until bedtime.5. Mediocre instructions. While setting up the unit is easy and intuitive, there is much more to using it. There is not a coherent user manual. Instead there are several overlapping documents (equiv to Quick Start Guides), various FAQs and lots of blog-style postings. Many of these are erroneous, ambiguous, contradictory or incomplete.[1] It took me more than a 10 days to start up my unit because I repeatedly reached my frustration limit trying to hunt through the web pages to find what I thought were answers to basic questions (I am not a \"Just do it\" person). There were too many clicks and searches yielding too little result. I kept muttering that it shouldn't be that hard. Part of what you are paying for with a product like this are instructions and guides to use it successfully. But as in the manufacturing, there are big deficiencies here.Note: My professional background makes me inclined to get a more complete understanding than the typical user, partly from a well-earned paranoia. And I do understand that there are people for whom ferreting out such info is part of the joy of products such as this.6. In poking around on the AG website, I discovered many complaints about problems with the water pump. Under \"Accessories > Replacement Parks\" the description for the pump begins \"Keep your garden growing at its best with periodic pump replacement\". Looking at the pump in my unit, I had to wonder if the reliability problems were simply the result of AG skimping on this part.7. When I went to register my unit, the web site offered $125 of coupons for signing up for the newsletter. 90% of those were discounts on buying other models. Hold it. I have just started using it -- I am hardly ready to buy another, either for myself or as a gift. Marketing wisdom is that those coupons should either be to reduce the shock of the cost of supplies or to encourage purchase of add-ons that could make the user more satisfied/enthusiastic with operation.----Using for transplants:I was strongly considering using this to start transplants in the spring, but after looking at the details, I am reconsidering.1. In looking at comments on the AG website, I found numerous complaints about poor success rates. I expected transplanting from a hydroponic environment to a normal garden to be more involved than normal transplanting. What I expected to find, but didn't, were articles of the form \"How to successfully transplant\" and \"Common mistakes made in transplanting\".2. One needs to look at the comments under their \"Seed Starting System\" and not just the description. This is Styrofoam and people report that it is often non-reusable because it breaks as you remove the inserts (Grow Sponges) for transplant. And it floats on the surface of the water -- none of the air circulation around the roots that AG advertises as so beneficial (and I didn't find an explanation of why). And why don't they need the Grow Domes and the Pod Labels? Especially since the Pod Labels are advertised as useful/important in reducing the evaporation of water from the tank when you have the normal 7 pods vs 66 pods for the Seed Starting System.3. The insert is similar to theHydrofarm JSEF55 Smart Float Grow Tray with Plugs(and about the same price per position). Searching keyed to that product and its ilk may produce useful advice (I haven't looked yet).==== Examples of problem in the documentation ====1. The maintenance schedule omits any mention of the existence of the filter on the water pump, much less cleaning it and changing it (every 6-8 months). I discovered this when scanning the product offerings on the web site. Similarly, the online maintenance schedule hadn't been updated to include this model (the Ultra). This sort of sloppiness is common.Plus: The filters are very inexpensive, bur rather than including several changes, you have to purchase them, with S&H; making them *very* expensive (better alternative: go to a B&M; fish/aquarium store).2. When I clicked on what was advertised as an online tutorial for new owners, what I got was a brochure targeted at potential buyers formatted to be a glossy hardcopy handout. Most small startups try to avoid this mistake, and there is no excuse for a mature company to do it.3. The documentation for the control panel is minimal -- just enough to get you started. I put water in the tank and started experimenting, but who knows what I missed or misunderstood.4. When I looked at the advice on growing seeds for transplants, it said that the baskets came in two parts which were held together by the Pod Label. And in the AG product listing, there are \"Easy Transplant Baskets\" that \"snap away\". However, when I looked very closely at the right picture, \"snap\" seems to mean \"break\" not \"disengage\". Minor, but this is an example of the casualness of their descriptions.5. For the seed kits, the descriptions of the plants can be vague. For example, it treats \"cherry tomato\" as good enough, ignoring/oblivious to the fact that there are a wide range of cherry tomatoes for different tastes and uses. I know that they have adapted some of the plants to better fit, but why not say \"similar to variety X\"?6. Statements with no explanation. For example \"baskets help regulate moisture levels in pods\". I could find no info on when I needed to change what was happening or how to accomplish that. Or was this simply puffery?7. Fertilizer is specified using different units in different places: Milli-liters, fluid ounces, and \"season\". I can convert between the first two, but why don't they just give both together (eg, with a parenthetical). As to \"season\", if you look around on the AG website, you can find the Rosetta Stone. This is yet another example of AG not putting what seem to be normal efforts into making their documentation user-friendly.-- Douglas B. Moran TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This is a combined small unit of grow lights over a water tank with pump that is designed for the purpose of hydroponic growing indoors.  The brochure included shows a photo of it on a kitchen counter and a very warm temperature range for the room is recommended in the instructions.  I will review each component separately:The three bulbs in the plastic hood are on a pole with clamps, so that it can be adjusted to be right over the plants.  The pole \"snapped\" into the hood a little less snug than I had expected, but it does function suitably.The seed \"pods\" came in an open plastic cone and are embedded in what looks like a synthetic foam, rather than an actual organic or mineral material.  (I took them out of that.)  Are all the seed from China, too?  Every component should be labeled with honest disclosure, as consumers demand.I looked for the common triangle on the plastic tub that would indicate what type of plastic it is made of, since it is made in China, but found none.  The \"trellis system\" is two plastic bands that strap together around the plants.  The pump seemed noisier than expected.  The little bottle of \"plant nutrient\" included is lab chemicals that the label directs the reader to look up on a website address ending with the word \"metals.\"  Nice.  (I won't be using any of that on any actual food plants.)I ran through various scenarios on the little electronic screen of the \"control panel\" on the tub, but found several of the instructions to be either way overly simplified or too inflexible to be of much use.  Those who already have growing experience, particularly indoors, will already know how important on-the-spot judgement is for a whole host of variables that cannot be simply codified without looking at the plants.The upshot for me, as an experienced organic grower, is that some features of this unit are usable while others are undesirable.  There is way too much plastic for my tastes, and I would prefer that most or all of the unit be made in the USA with more durability in mind.

Since the garden has awhile before it produces anything I wanted to write down my first impressions. The unit is very well made and will stand the test of time. The idea is simple its based upon hydroponics and the Pods are self contained. The idea is to set the pods into the base. Fill the base with water and nutrients turn on the grow lamps and in time the seeds will sprout and the plants will grow. Its really impressive looking and my wife and I are excited about kitchen side herbs. We were lucky to have a space for the unit close by to the Kitchen. If I can remember in a couple of weeks I will write a followup. Looks good. TL;DR:",

As it warms up, I expect to move it around the garden a few times to get a look at what it thinks of how much sun is available in the locations I have.For now, it's sitting with a plant and telling me how long it expects it to be before I need to water again, and it's also reminding me to fertilize.Sunlight is kind of a troublesome issue. It wants me to move the plant to where there's more, but the plant itself is getting more than the device is just because of how they're sitting relative to the window (and the leaves providing some shade). I also sort of wish there were a &#34;Winter&#34; mode that understood that my houseplants are probably going to have to survive with less sun for a little while, and that it might be good ease up on the fertilizer for the time being as well.I'd also really like a mode where you just put it somewhere, and then ask the database to tell you what types of plants would be likely to live in this spot happily.On the whole, it's neat to play with and there's definitely some utility to having one around. When my plants seem sickly, I'll now have a much better tool to help me figure out what I'm doing wrong. Up to now, I've tended to just end up having to buy a new plant. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This seems a handy device for plants you wish to fuss over, because it monitors temperature, light, and fertilizer(?), as well as moisture.  Most of my garden plants have been here for ages so I don't worry about them, but for rooting cuttings, or transplanting, I have to be very careful not to let them dry out. This is a great device for doing so because I check my iphone regularly anyway.  I put the flower power app iconon the front screen, and if something needs attention, I get a red badge on the icon so that I know to open it up and see what the sensor is saying (if it is an issue I don't feel like dealing with at the moment, I can \"Ignore\" it and the badge goes away). I'm considering getting another for the front yard bouganvillia which turns brown unless it is kept moist (the others do fine in the summer), and so I am going to try using this sensor to water it just when it needs it but not more.I had no problems setting it up or connecting with the device, and it was easy to define identify what plant was being monitored (so the software would know what conditions that particular plant needs).  Once it has been running for a while, you can see the plants environmental measures over time (last day, week, month, and so forth), or query the current status via \"Live\" mode. You an also view the status over the web, assuming it has synced. I would like to know how to get an alarm or alert of freezes in my vegetable garden, but at the moment I don't see how to do that.  It lets you add and define multiple sensors so you can monitor multiple indoor and/or outdoor plants if you buy more.The iphone app is a bit large, 109mb, I guess due to the large database, so downloading took a while.  Note that it only works on newer (lower power bluetooth) iphones, so check your hardware before assuming it will work with yours.The database includes some Calif. native plants, and includes lots of mediterranean climate plants, unlike garden resources I have encountered in the past that are suited only for moister climates. It is useful for telling you care information for the plants you already have, but it is not as useful for searching for additional plants that meet the requirements of your climate.  That is, I can filter plants by type, color, bloom season, etc., but I cannot filter by hardiness or by moisture requirements.  So for example, I wanted to find perennial edibles to plant, but the 600+ list that resulted contains plants mostly unsuited to my area.  Even though once you click on a plant, that information is in the entry for that plant, so they just need to improve the search function to capture those additional constraints. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "In our family, the care and feeding of our yard is my job. While I'm generally comfortable working with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowers, I welcome knowledgeable advice. That's why I was eager to put this helpful Parrot to work.I'll focus here on showing how the Parrot works out of the box and what it's like tapping into the specific data you gather and augmenting your knowledge with the plant library the app provides. Thus far, the unit and app both seem to be working well (including the day I let my plant dry out to see whether that would trigger a \"water me\" alert, which it did).Since I \"drive\" the Parrot with my phone, I was able to snap some screen shots for you. I've placed them, with annotations, in the customer images section on the product page.  These shots include live-action shots and historical data. The app archives data so that you can review in daily, weekly, and monthly view.  The Parrot unit gathers and stores data and transmits it via Bluetooth. The Flower Power app communicates with the \"Parrot Cloud\" by way of 3G, 4G or wifi.Setup is simple, but remind yourself that it takes at least 24 hours for the Parrot to generate its first report. In the meantime, you can dig into the Flower Power database, and start building your \"garden,\" by selecting other plants with which you will want to work. Each time your search nets a result, you can add that plant to your garden. You can personalize entries by taking photos of your plants, or use the images provided in the database. You have access to 6,000 plants.Be sure that the Flower Power app recognizes your physical location; this simple but necessary step helps with future use. Indeed, during initial use, I received notification that an update for my location (Hawaii) was available; depending on your location, you may receive a similar prompt.Speaking of locations, I am in Zone 10, which isn't ideal for some of the plants I would like to grow. However, I've checked through the app and located support for several flowers I plan to grow this year, including particular varieties of crocus and tulips. In years past, I've had varying results with these plants, so I hope that the Parrot will mean a better outcome this year.In order to make best use of the app, I would need to have multiple Parrot units. The workaround I've been using is to move the Parrot from one plant to the next on a weekly basis. In several more months, I will evaluate the overall benefit of the Parrot unit and the Flower Power database, and decide whether to buy additional units.If you have questions about the unit or the app, please post in the comments, and I will respond as soon as possible.

Unfortunately the app doesn't help track how much you add each time and calculate future needs based on those results. Also the app does not track anything as to the size or age of the plant so it isn't fine tuned to help with starting seedlings.I have moved the device around to several plants and it is easy to update to the new plant. However you won't get advice until it has been with the plant for 24 hours. Understandable for temperature and sunlight but I would like to be able to get water and fertilizer recommendations more immediately.Even before the 24 hours and the automated alerts/todo list the app generates you can always monitor live and see the results of adding water, changing temp, or sunlight exposure. The results are immediate but there is no indication as to the target recommended.This is a very cool device and every plant I have used it on has benefited greatly by the recommended actions. However at this price it would be tough to justify very many of these. I look forward to app improvements and I hope they optimize for iPad as it is only available in the iphone app store right now which doesn't make vest use of the larger iPad screen. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I've owned a couple of EasyBloom devices (later sold to Black and Decker) and now this Parrot Flower Power to monitor plant conditions.  Although I'm an experienced gardener, I have houseplants located in areas that I forget to check as well as the occasional struggling plant.  The original EasyBloom didn't have soil fertility information, and when the next generation did, with a paid fertilization subscription, I was thrilled.  I was worried that this Parrot Flower Power wouldn't have that information, and again, I was thrilled that it did.  After all, an experienced gardener can tell whether a plant is likely getting the right amount of sun or water, but the richness of the soil is an entirely different matter.  For this reason, the Flower Power promises to work for both beginning and intermediate -- maybe even advanced -- gardeners.  Still, it needs some work to be a five-star product.First, a warning:  this works only on iPhones.  Not computers.  Not Android devices, although the web site promises that function soon.  Not even on an iPad.  This kind of limited use suggests the release of a product that should have waited several more months before introduction.  Fortunately, I have an iPhone.  There are other drawbacks -- I'll get to them at the end.  The iPhone app is relatively easy to use, although not elegant.To setting up the device is relatively easy, although you'll have to wait for 24 hours before the information starts getting sent to your device and alert email address.  All you need to do is download the free app, create your account, insert the included AAA battery, select the plant you will be monitoring from the database, insert the monitor into the soil, and wait.  Some people have complained that the information gathered is too vague; however, if your plant isn't getting enough light, just move it to a sunnier location and see whether that's enough.  If it needs more water, give it some, and if it's too wet, wait longer between waterings.  If it needs fertilizer, give it a dose and wait to see if it's enough.  The fact that this device CAN analyze soil fertility is pretty amazing.  Think about it.  Unless you are a master gardener with the proper tools, you are unlikely to be able to make more than an educated guess about whether your plant has enough food.The database of plants and information is large enough for most people.  I like that I entered \"Mona Lavender\", and the database came back with the correct hit, albeit in a different name:  Swedish Ivy.  The search function cross-references plant names, as long as you spell them correctly.  If you don't know the name of your plant, you won't be able to monitor it unless you assign a random plant to your garden.  You can monitor up to 256 Flower Power devices (imagine the cost!), one at a time, supposedly in sequence.Unfortunately, despite the potential of this device, it has some drawbacks besides the limited platform.  The device works using a Bluetooth connection, which limits the range.  If you put the Parrot outside or in a remote part of your house, you have to have your iPhone nearby and for long enough to receive the data.  Ideally, this device should be configured to work both over a home network AND via Bluetooth to a phone.  Because I'm monitoring a plant outside of my normal Bluetooth range (that's why I'm monitoring it -- I tend to forget about it), I don't always get the alerts in a timely manner that it needs water.  The GOOD part of the Bluetooth capabilities, however, is that you can monitor a plant far away from your computer.  I have a large property, and I can monitor a remote planting as long as I get close enough for the Flower Power to upload the data.  The instructions are a mess, too.  Instead of giving all instructions in English, then French, then Spanish, etc., the instructions give a little in English, then switch to the other languages, then back to English.  I had to weed through all the other languages to find the next set of information.  As a result, the set-up seemed much more complicated than it really was.I like this device a lot, although it could use improvements and enhancements.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "When I got a chance to review this product, I had read that an Android app would be available in January 2014. When I went to the Parrot website, however, they could only provide a signup to be notified when the Android version is available \"sometime in the first half of 2014.\" I'll have to update my actual experience with the monitor itself after the free Android app comes out. For those who already have Apple products, there's a free app that allows you to access the online plant database to monitor the needs of various types of plants and also read the sensor.This review is going to deal with my initial impressions only. First, I've used the early Easy Bloom product, which requires you to physically dump data onto your computer via a USB plug-in thingie. The Flower Power monitors more than the Easy Bloom (fertilizer needs!) and is wireless to boot. I didn't like how the Easy Bloom app was always \"on,\" hogging resources; I'm hoping the Flower Power will be different.Both products depend on accessing data from a web site, but I found Parrot's database to be a lot more accessible. Even without the app or the product hooked up, I was able to check out the database and will use it to help me plan what I plant this spring when, hopefully, I'll have the Android app. First, there's an A-to-Z sorter at the top of the page, and there are also great filters: Type (Grass, Interior Plants, Shrubs, Trees, Vines, Edibles), Shape/Habit, Bloom Color, Leaf Color, Lifetime (Annual, Biennial, Perennial), and Bloom Season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). A search box not only finds what you look for, it tells you how many instances it found. So, for \"cucumbers,\" I got 33 varieties/hits; \"bush bean,\" 25 hits; \"bean,\" 68 hits, including bush beans, lima beans, regular old beans, plus anything that has \"bean\" in the common name, like Jacobean lily, Castor bean, Lucky bean tree, and Caribbean Red (pepper).Without the app, you can go to parrot/flowerpower and peruse the database to see how it's laid out. I found it very accessible and appealing, with its clear layout and wonderful photos, and it includes very helpful planting and plant care info, both hardiness and heat zones, even interesting facts about the plants&mdash;all in a very enjoyable-to-explore format. However, I realized quickly that the database is all in metric&mdash;which is Greek to most U.S. residents like me. (I left them a suggestion that they might want to at least put in a converter for those of us who just won't get with the metric program.)I'm really looking forward to planting tomatoes in my new Tomato Success Kits, which I can roll out into the sun in front of my apartment (the back's too shady), and I was at first delighted to see all the varieties (114 search hits!) of tomatoes (with great photos) in the database. But one problem immediately presented itself: the database does not include the super-essential (for container gardeners) indeterminate vs. determinate info for the tomatoes, so more research will be required once you've narrowed down your choices. I didn't spend a lot of time in the database looking at other edibles I might plant, but those who have specific veggies or fruits they wish to plant need to check them out to be sure the information they need is included. Of course, I'm sure the monitor itself could care less if a tomato is determinate or indeterminate. It's going to base its information on how much light, water, and fertilizer is there for the plant and also the temperature. It's up to container gardeners to figure out what's going to work in a planting.On the whole, so far I'm really impressed and hope that Android app is out in time for me to use the Flower Power this spring.

It comes in a cute package that makes a great gift idea. I am buying one for my mother for her birthday. When she comes over for coffee she is always asking how the plants are doing now.I loaded my plants, took a picture of them to set as their I.d. but you can use the stock photos.It gives me a graph for water, fertilizer, sunlight, and temperature. Graphs your plant up to a year.I found out I was watering my plants too much, now I only water when it says, the Flower power app gets a number on it when there are things to do, l also had to move my plants, as they were not getting enough sun. I can't wait to get to use this in the garden. You can use it on more than one plant, I switch mine between pots every 5-6 days, it still gives advice to care for the plant that its not currently in. It has a huge plant database, example there are 30 types of cucumbers, and 110 tomatoes, even though it doesn't have them all yet, it didn't have my Mimosa Pudica but I placed it under a similar fern. The database tells you if you can eat the plant or not, its life cycle, bloom color, leaf color, shape, height range, spread range, and long description and history along with watering needs, sunlight requirements, temperature zones, and how much fertilizer it needs. Planting instructions, growth habit, how it blooms and when you can harvest it. how to fertilizer and prune, what to do about pests and its climate zone.

I water my plants a lot less now because even if it looks dry on top they have water at the roots.I also fertilize more often, but now I don't worry about it, I let the flower power tell me.I will either put this back up by the kitchen garden where it can catch the wifi or put the app back on the phone, I miss the auto updates but am curious how often it would be using the wifi if it had free rein.I really like this product.Have not needed to change batteries yet.

Like, I would like to be riding the train home from the city and I suddenly get a text or notification like &#34;hey, you need to water the plants!&#34; I need this because I tend to forget and they tend to die. It doesn't work that way, though. Instead I have to open up the app, on my iPad (because that's where I installed it, although the app is designed for iPhone), stand close enough to the sensor to connect via bluetooth and see what it says. Well heck, if I remember to do that I guess I could remember to water. The first time it told me I needed to water, I saw that the (well, it's a tub of lawn grass I grow for my cats) was already sopping wet. I repositioned the sensor and that seemed to help and it's more accurate now, although I'm not really sure how much water to give when it says I need to water and when it tells me more light is needed well, 1.) I had to input a different variety of grass because mine wasn't listed, and mine is a shade-tolerant variety, so I'm not sure it's right and 2.) It's on a balcony and more light just aint gonna happen...at least not until summer. The grass LOOKS healthy, though.I'm a bit confused...if I'm told the plant isn't getting enough light, is that just RIGHT NOW...or am I getting an average from the whole day? I would like to be able to go in and tweak the parameters.The packaging for this is cute but it's WAY overpackaged. It's made to look like a flower growing in a box. If you're giving one as a gift, it would look nice. If you're buying yourself ten of them...annoying.Overall, I think this has some potential since at least the app can be updated at any time to be better...but the bluetooth is a limiting factor, unless I get some kind of firmware update that allows it to connect with my computer that has bluetooth and then from there send me and email or some kind of message when I'm away. Also, I should be able to use it on more than one device (like my iPad AND my iPhone) for the same Flower Power, since I'm sometimes using one and sometimes the other.

Parrott says this will last 6 months, but in any case, AAA are simple and cheap.The app then installs easily, it&#8217;s pretty simple to sync via Bluetooth as long as its powered on for your device. The range is probably 10-15 feet. Before setting up a plant, you will need to register with Parrot.

Once my iPad mini is out of range though, you won&#8217;t be collecting continuous data.

You can also get live data from the device, which is actually pretty cool (and at least I know the temperature reading is accurate.) The app pushes you heavily to monitor all your plants.

        "reviewText": "First of all, I may not be the market for this product, a beginner gardener.  I am an Extension Master Gardener, educated and certified by my state university and I teach horticulture classes.  As such, I am comfortable learning the conditions my plants need and whether I can meet them.  Perhaps this would be better for someone who has no clue as to whether something needs watering, but my use of this has made me not very trusting in its advice.The instruction sheet had several languages and was quite hard to follow.  I found the English, but it was not laid out in a manner that made any sense.I put this in a potted Meyer lemon tree that I keep indoors during the winter.  The plant should probably be repotted and I know the soil is not optimal. I fertilize it at appropriate times for the plant and its condition (over-fertilizing and over-watering kill most houseplants).  I was able to select the plant from the app's plant database.  It gave a little description of the care conditions.This takes 24 hours before you get the first real readings, which tell you if the plant has enough water, light and fertilizer.  It analyzes the fertilizer needs by checking the salts level.  I am not sure which salts it checks.  You can see a live analysis of all but the fertilizer and a chart telling you what the levels have been live and at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year increments.  I am not quite sure why the long history would be needed.The sensor checks the first few inches of the soil.  Depending on the plant, this may not be where most of the roots are, and the condition around the roots are what counts.  I had just watered the plant and it said the water was fine.  It said the plant needed fertilizer.  I don't think it does as it doesn't need a lot this time of year, but as I wanted to see how well this worked, I fertilized it with a liquid fertilizer, which should have hit the sensor.  The display continued to tell me I needed fertilizer until, after several days, I told it that I had done that.  This would not give a beginning gardener any indication if they had under- or over-fertilized.The database told me that Meyer lemons needed four (out of five) dots for the fertilization level.  The analysis does not use the same dot scale, but instead a 0-5.  The analysis is showing a very low level (about .5), but the &#34;to do&#34; list no longer shows it needs fertilizer.  I would much prefer a consistency between the recommendations and analysis.  The only factor that is consistent is the temperature, which is given in degrees on the plant care and analysis.My plant needs as much sun as I can give it indoors.  I have it in a south window, but the size of the plant makes it shade the sensor during parts of the day. Because of this, it tells me I don't get enough light.  I would be O.K. with this, but I know that part of the problem is that the sensor is shaded by plant leaves as the sun moves.  I had to tell it I moved the plant and the warning went away.  It hasn't come back and I didn't really move anything, so I don't have a lot of confidence in this.It is telling me my water is fine, (again, the analysis is %, but the plant care guide shows water drops), but by looking at it I can tell it needs watering.  The live monitor says the level is at 17% and the plant care recommendation says the plant needs two (out of five) water drops.  I am going to give it another day and see if it tells me to water, but my experience tells me I should be watering it today.Ideally this could be used for a week or two for a gardener to learn the needs of a plant, then moved to another plant or turned off.  However, the fact that I can't trust what it is telling me makes me unlikely to recommend it.  Sorry. TL;DR:",

The odor was pleasantly light and quickly disappeared. It was not sticky or oily. I spent a good six  hours outside working to prepare an area for my garden.

Yes, this goes on &#34;dryer&#34; and has a bit less scent, but not worth double the price.  And yes, 25% DEET is going to work well on repelling mosquitoes and ticks.  Caution:  One reviewer asked if they should spray it on their pets... this is not recommended for them because they will lick it off their coat and this is NOT for internal use.So yes it works and it's expensive.  It dries quickly and leaves less of a scent that other insect repellents (aka pesticides)... and the locking cap is a great design so it won't go off in your backpack.  I used this on a warm summer night when mosquitoes were buzzing about and it definitely kept them at bay... but then I took a shower once I returned inside to wash this stuff off.Now let's talk about DEET for a minute and also discuss alternatives...DEET was created by the United States Army in World War II for jungle warfare.  It was originally tested as a pesticide on crops, entering civilian use in 1957 and enjoying widespread use during the Vietnam War.  This is serious stuff which is why this is listed as &#34;backwoods&#34; meaning you don't just use this for a day in the park with your family.  This is if you are doing some serious trekking or if you're in a malarial or high West Nile region where a mosquito bite can be dangerous.The June 2014 Consumer Reports has a good spread on insect repellents and includes a sidebar titled &#34;Insect repellents: choose carefully&#34; where it discusses the dangers of DEET including &#34;seizures, slurred speech and coma after people have ingested it or applied it for more than 3 days in a row...&#34; and says the higher the DEET concentration the more risk.  So just because this is in a pretty green can you shouldn't spray it all over everything in sight especially your kids.. and I personally wouldn't use this on any child except as a last resort.  The CDC says not to use this on any child under 3.  I would quadtruple that at least.  Consumer Reports recommends &#34;Off Family Care Smooth and Dry&#34; which is only 15% DEET and also lists some more natural alternatives, such as repellents with 20% picaridin.You might want to try &#34;Cutter Advanced 6-Ounce 7-Percent Picaridin Insect Repellent Pump Spray&#34; which as of this writing is kid-friendly and works GREAT for us... we used it all over Bali, Indonesia where the mosquitoes are like fire-fueled vampires and it kept them at bay.  If you're just sitting in your backyard or at a camp get some citronella candles / torches to help keep the biting bugs at bay.So do your homework and only use this stuff as a last resort and be really careful about applying it to children.  I don't mean to be alarmist ... but from some of the reviews I've read it's apparent to me that some aren't really taking the precautions and warnings on the label seriously.  And people wonder why we have a cancer epidemic in this country... go more natural if you can and only bring out the big insecticide bomb if nothing else works!  And DO NOT spray this on your pet!! Please!Hope this helps and happy trekking and camping! TL;DR:",

It must be used sparingly and should NEVER be used on babies or very young children. It's far better to cover up the skin that to bomb it with chemicals. Also, remember that there are many natural insect repellants (look them up online, there is a lot written about them) and I grow several scented geranium plants in my container garden every summer to use for repelling mosquitos. Lemon-scented geranium is very simple to grow in a pot and breaking off a few leaves and rubbing them on your skin works very well. Also, you can still buy \"punks\" in some stores and online and if you're just sitting in the yard or in a park/beach, burning a few inexpensive punks will give all the protection you need.So, am I just being paranoid or is DEET actually dangerous? Well, here is what the EPA says on their site:Read and follow all directions and precautions on this product label.Do not apply over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.Do not apply to hands or near eyes and mouth of young children.Do not allow young children to apply this product.Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.Do not use under clothing.Avoid over-application of this product.After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.Wash treated clothing before wearing it again.Use of this product may cause skin reactions in rare cases. The following additional statements will appear on the labels of all aerosol and pump spray formulation labels:Do not spray in enclosed areas.To apply to face, spray on hands first and then rub on face. Do not spray directly onto face.My suggestion with products like Cutter is to spray it on your clothing and not on your skin. Tie a kerchief around your neck and spray that and it will protect your face quite a bit.I'm not trying to trash Cutter here, by the way. I gave the three stars because the product does indeed work quite well. But it would be irresponsible of me to say, sure, slather this on, without acknowledging that there are dangers. I have downgraded it two stars because I think these companies should acknowledge the dangers more--particularly for babies and children. But if you use it sparingly when you are in infested areas and if you wash up afterwards, it's probably an acceptable risk for adults. Lyme disease and West Nile are terrible things and I would have to say the risk of DEET dangers is probably low by comparison--but that does not make it 100% safe. Do some online research and draw your own conclusions. I will carry this Cutters with me (I like the dry-spray, by the way, that's not just hype, it's far less oily) and, when the situation is desperate, I will apply it. TL;DR:",

It is perfect for casual outdoor festivities when you don't want to look like you've been sprayed with diesel fuel.The Cutter Backwoods Dry 25% can be applied generously with no side effects - and it works.  The biggest negative might be the cost which is rather expensive.  However, when considering the consequences of not using adequate protection against mosquito viruses, cost is not a factor.If you are working outdoors and sweat profusely like some people I know, the longer lasting and stronger the better - as long as your skin will tolerate it.One problem I've had when I spray my face is DEET running into my eyes carried by perspiration.  I spray a Terry Cloth head band with Permethrin and wear a broad brim hat treated the same.  That seems to work better for me anyway.I've used most every mosquito repellant there is.  Some are better than others, however, even with the best, if you miss a spot, the little blood-suckin' buggers will find it.I spend a good deal of time outdoors during the summer months - and in Georgia - mosquito repellant is a necessity.For years, I have used the 40% Deet formula advertised for those who enjoy living in swamps and jungles.100% Deet causes a burning sensation on my skin.  It doesn't blister or cause a rash but it is uncomfortable.Clinical studies have proven that some people have an allergy to 100% Deet.I have an old military buddy in Maine who had to go to the hospital because he used too much 100% Deet on a fishing trip.As if West Nile Virus was not bad enough, in 2014, we have a new mosquito-borne Chikungunya Virus to worry about in the USA.  There is no vaccine and no cure.  It can last for 3 years and the joint pain can be excruciating.My formula is simple.  I apply a liberal amount of Permethrin to my clothing until damp. Sawyer Permethrin will last for several washings.  Don't worry if it accidentally contacts your skin.  It is harmless to your skin but it does lose its effectiveness.Next, I spray every bit of exposed skin with Deet repellant.  My face, ears, and neck especially appreciate the gentle kindness shown by Cutter Dry Backwoods 25%.Okay, maybe I do spray twice as much 25% as I do the 40%, but it feels twice as good after it dries.Auto makers use crash test dummies to determine the safety of their cars.I need a dummy other than myself that I can sit out in the back yard and fill will poison fake plasma and CO2 and let the mosquitoes suck on him until they die.Wouldn't that be better than a $350.00 propane mosquito trap that's only 50% effective?

According to a study by the Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association, &#34;DEET formulations (20%-34%) offered 3&#8211;6 hours of protection.&#34; There is also some health questions about using DEET directly on the skin, especially on children (you should do your own research on these issues). I tend to use more natural substances directly on my skin (mainly a citronella oil mix) and limit the use of products such as this to only my clothing. Also, I tend not to wear dark clothing, which attracts mosquitoes more than lighter-colored clothing. It's also good to avoid wearing fragrances or using perfumed shampoo or soap before going outside.This product is great when used with care and realistic expectations. If you plan a long day out in the woods or at the time of year when mosquitoes are plentiful, carry this or other repellents with you to apply every few hours. Keep in mind that if you are sweating from work or play (sweat also attracts mosquitoes), you may need to apply this product more often. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "While I respect all wildlife, there are times when the prudent human draws a line that specifies that it is best that the wildlife be on one side and humans be on the other. So it is true with pigeons, who are known to carry diseases that are very harmful to humans. They also leave a mess where they roost. In my climate pigeons tend to make their homes in areas that help to keep them out of the hot sun. I don't wish to harm them, only to discourage them from roosting in certain areas where their droppings have the potential of spreading disease or disfiguring the exterior walls of the house. In my house there are really only 2-3 such areas, one of them right over the front entrance door.Previously we had used \"chicken wire\" to prevent the pigeons from roosting in these areas.  However it is unattractive and it is possible the birds could become enmeshed in the wire, which is not the intent.During a recent whole-home remodel in which the exterior was repainted, we removed all of the chicken wire and added Bird B Gone spikes in the two areas in which pigeon droppings could potentially fall on children, guests or food.  We started with the stainless steel spikes and also wanted to compare the Lucite spikes which cost less.  This review compares the two.Despite the fact that the Lucite spikes are clear, the stainless steel spikes actually call less attention to themselves. Both have pointy ends that discourage unwanted guests from roosting but neither would be considered harmful or lethal to wildlife as they are more of a deterrent.The pro for the metal spikes is that they are shiny and wave in the wind which makes noise, all of which discourage the birds before they even get near. The downside of that is that the vibration can get a little annoying to humans in the house. For any given length they are a bit lighter than the plastic version.  Another downside is that the cost is quite a bit more.The pro for the plastic spikes is that they cost less and are equally as effective. They are very rigid and do not vibrate. But the clear material is also shiny and will most likely discourage a bird before it even comes close. I tried to break off a spike of the plastic variety and it did not break easily. Time will tell which best survives harsh weather conditions (I will update this review if I find any huge advantages of one over the other).A couple of final observations ...1. Installation with glue is much easier than installing with screws. Nobody wants to make screw holes in their roof nor glue anything to it but it's a necessary evil and let's face reality, most people will never remove bird spikes once they are installed.2. If you use glue be sure to put a dollop of glue where each screw hole is. The glue will ooze through the hole and act as a very strong screw to help hold the strip down.3. Be sure to let the spikes hang over the edge of the mounting surface 1 - 2\". This will help discourage the birds before they start to roost.4. Try mounting the strip with the spikes pointing out rather than up (this works especially well with the plastic strips). This mounting will be just as effective with almost no risk of harming the bird or catching debris.  In my installation it also makes the Lucite plastic spikes much less visible from street level.If birds are a nuisance or potential health hazard where you live, bird spikes can be a worthwhile way of telling the birds to seek shelter elsewhere without harming them. Bird B Gone seems to own the residential market for such products (although there are many, more expensive, solutions) and they are reasonably well made. They are not cheap but after all this is one of those expenses you do once and shouldn't have to think about again for many years down the road. TL;DR:",

Those are probably better for lifting rather that flipping and shredding.  These meat claws have six sturdy tines and even though they aren&#8217;t made of metal, do a great job shredding meat.  They also work well for holding down a piece of meat while slicing.I haven&#8217;t tried scooping charcoal in or out of the grill, but no doubt they would work well for that.  The tines themselves are approximately 1-3/4&#8221; long and the entire &#8220;paw&#8221; is a full 4-1/4&#8221; wide.  The tips of the tines are quite sharp and easily stab and hold anything I tried.  The plastic is quite solid and I was easily able to grip and work them both in tandem.  No learning curve here.If you are into pork pulling and are no pro with a couple of forks, these will work quite nicely.  I even tried using them as mixers and even though they are shorter than a salad fork and spoon set, they worked quite well.

These claws are the best thing to come along for that task than anything I can remember.When I was offered a review sample I thought they were cast iron - it turns out they are nylon, but are as strong as any metal utensils I have used. They are relatively light, rigid, but with a little give, and the pair of them can easily withstand the weight of a ten pound piece of meat (the largest size I tried lifting with them.)While these are excellent for lifting and transporting meat, they were designed to shred it and that they do. Once you get the hang of using them - a very slight learning curve - you can shred meat like a hungry raptor. There is sufficient room between the handle portion and the claws to keep you from burning or scalding your knuckles as long as you hold them perpendicular to the meat while you are working on it. Coming at a large piece of meat from a lesser angle can blister your knuckles. Also, the claws are pretty sharp and require the same level of respect as a razor sharp knife. But if you exercise caution and common sense these are completely safe.Although they are of nylon they will not easily melt. They can withstand 450 degrees F, so they are dishwasher safe. I will caution you to thoroughly clean them with a strong jet of water on the back side because there are channels behind the claws that can collect meat. Even if you machine wash them, take care to remove meat from that part of the claws because that is a weak point from a sanitary perspective. Again, common sense and diligent attention to sanitation will prevent problems.I tried these out the same day they arrived and am impressed. So nuch so that I intend to recommend a pair to family and friends because they and not only handy, but essential if you prepare shredded or pulled barbeque. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This solar-powered light system has a lot to recommend it, and just a couple of flaws.  Let&#8217;s start with the good:1. It&#8217;s amazingly bright, for a solar-powered system.  Anyone who has installed the old-style solar powered outdoor lights knows that they are bright enough to show people where the lights are, but not exactly useful in providing actual illumination.  The d.light system isn't as bright as an incandescent bulb (or a CF, for that matter), but it does a reasonable job of lighting the area.  And since the cords between the lights and the controllers are long, you can spread them out to light a wider area or mass them to create more intense light.2. The lights are individually controlled and each one has a high power/low power option, so you can decide for yourself how to choose between brightness and the length of time your system will function without a recharge.3. The system is advertised as providing light for a long time.  One light on low power operates for 15 hours.  Operating both lights high power, the system operates for 3.5 hours.  But even that is a pretty long time if, for instance you are lighting a cabin, tent or garden shed.  Also, the lights glowed brightly even with just a couple of hours of sun.4. It is simple to install; all you need is a drill and screwdriver to install the 10 screws.  The instructions consist of three pictures and about that many some self-evident sentences. But that&#8217;s all you need.The flaws are minor, but  worth mentioning:1. It&#8217;s fairly pricey.  At $185, this system is worthwhile only if it&#8217;s going to last a while. Otherwise, you are better off hanging an LED-powered flashlight with rechargeable batteries from the ceiling. The system is guaranteed for two years, but since this is a new product, there&#8217;s no telling how long it will actually last.2. There is no mounting hardware. One would think that it would not be too difficult for the manufacturer to add the include screws to fasten the solar panel, the four screws to attach the two controllers and the two screws for the lights. It also wouldn't be too difficult to include cable staples to hold the wires in place, which are conveniently pictured in the instructions but inconveniently not included in the package. Did I mention that the system is pricey?On the whole, this is a good product for lighting a shed, exterior garage or a one-room summer cabin. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The d.light D20 Solar Home System (SHS) Kit can be a valuable solar home system.  It comes with a solar panel, 2 LED lamps (high & low settings), an independent portable lantern that is quite bright on the high setting, and a power pack to charge mobile phones via a USB jack (6 adaptors included).We put the solar panel on the roof near the back of the house, the east side, where it gets lots of sunshine.  Plugging the LED lights into the control unit there is ample cord to extend the lights to the extremities of our 30 foot long deck.  We let the unit charge all of one day before trying it and it worked perfectly.  The lights lit up the deck area sufficiently to read outside if you wish, and the lantern was bright enough to light areas of the yard as we walked.However, the 2nd night we had a heavy snowfall accompanied by freezing rain and the unit put out very little power.  I suppose it is similar to all solar panels and subject to that limitation.  As the weather breaks this SHS will be moved to the back of our lot to light the storage sheds.  That is where this will be really helpful.  Lighting an area that is almost in total darkness with no streetlights around.  I will try to find a way to shelter the solar panel from heavy snow and ice during winter times, but its primary usage will be in spring, summer, and fall for yard work and home construction projects.By the way, the lantern included in this kit has several reviews on its own on Amazon.com.  The reviews are quite positive, which was my initial experience.  I am hopeful the lantern and the lights will decrease the activity of varmints in our back yard garden.  Electricity rates are too high to leave lights on all night, but the solar powered unit will eliminate those costs. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "Since building my tool shed last month, I've been looking for several lighting options that didn't require electrical hard wiring. I've been using lanterns with some degree of success. The opportunity to test the d.light D20 solar lighting system was most welcome. Down here on the coast, I knew getting enough sun would not be a problem for this unit. After almost two weeks use, these are my thoughts on this product.After reading over the instructions I took a brief inventory and inspection of the components. This kit includes (1) solar panel, (2) hanging LED light fixtures (2) wall switches, (1) LED lantern, (1) controller, (1) 20' cable, (4) electronic device adapters, (1) lantern cable and instructions. The company tags on a two year product replacement warranty. With the exception of the battery, the components for this lighting system are made of ABS. The initial set up went smooth. Instructions are easy to understand.A big plus is that the solar panel has holes for mounting. In no time I had it installed on the roof of my shed. The 20' cable was more then long enough to marry up with the controller. Afterwards I installed the two hanging LED lights in the rafters and mounted the wall switches. I hung the controller directly above my work bench. The wall switches have both a bright and dim setting. I also like the option of being able to operate the lights from the controller. All of the cables are fitted with jacks.It didn't even take a full 8 hours before I had enough juice in to operate the lights. The controller can also be charged via an AC adapter which for some odd reason was not included. No worries I had one that married up well with this unit. I'm glad the designer mounted an easy to read battery level indicator on the face of this box. In no time the lantern was at full charge. Its brighter then I thought it would be. I hung it on my tool rack for that extra bit of light. I was also able to charge all three of our cell phones without any issues.The true test came when I left these lights on the dim setting overnight. At 5 am the next morning I was pleasantly surprised to find that these puppies were still operating. This lightning system has been doing the job ever since. That's good enough for me. This is the first semi-portable solar lighting unit that I've run in to that has worked as advertised. Its more then capable of holding its own. The folks at Dlight got this one right. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I'm rating it 4 stars for the build quality, not usefulness or value for money.The product was much better built than I expected. It's mostly plastic, but feels solid, not cheap and flimsy.There are a few parts to the package. There's the panel (5W max. output), the combination charge controller / battery pack / output regulator, capacity unspecified. There are two wired lamps with switches, and one cordless lantern with its own rechargeable battery (capacity unspecified).The panel has mounting holes so that it can be fixed on a outdoor surface, and is the only part that is rated for outdoor use. All the other parts are for indoor use only.It appears to be meant for use at home, which is a rather strange proposition. The wired lights are rather weak for home use. They're bright enough for my weak eyes to read from 4 feet away at the low setting, but they're extremely weak compared to even a 40W incandescent bulb. It comes with 2 lights (each with its own switch) and you can add 2 more if you like. According to the manual, you can run 2 lights on high for 7 hours, or on low for 15 hours. With 4 lights, your runtime is cut down to 3.5 hours and 9 hours respectively.The lantern can run for 5 hours on high, and 10 hours on low. It is surprisingly light. It is charged through the USB port, but requires a special cable that ends in a very thin barrel plug. I wish it has a mini or micro USB port on it for charging instead. There are no indicators on it to show how much charge is remaining. The translucent diffuser can be unscrewed and removed if you prefer. Even at the high setting, it is noticeably dimmer than the wired light at its low setting.There doesn't appear to be an easy way of taking the charge controller / battery pack apart. No screws. This will be a problem when the batteries start to degrade. I'm not sure what batteries are in it, but there's space for 4 18650 (for about 20Wh of power). This sounds about right for a 5W solar panel.You can charge any USB device from the USB port. A cable with multiple tips is included, but you can always use your own USB cable instead.I can see this being more useful if you have a shed that's not wired for electricity. For home use, unless you're planning for power failure, you're much better off getting low wattage LED bulbs if your aim is to save money. It can come in useful if you're camping somewhere remote and don't want to carry enough batteries or USB battery packs to last that long.Again, in conclusion, a well built package that's complete and easy to set up, but unless you have a shed that doesn't have power, it probably isn't too useful at home. I wish the charge controller / battery pack is sealed for outdoors use, because that could have been very useful - a solar powered Arduino project with battery backup sounds quite exciting. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The uses for this are pretty broad. Any building without power, such as a shed or storage building. As attic lighting - if you have a window. Camping, inside a trailer - really anywhere you have access to the sun. Since it is solar, weather, trees, snow and amount and intensity of available light is important. In Utah, you'll get a full charge in 8 hours. In Chicago? Closer to 12 hours. But since most people will only use this for a few minutes at a time - or even a few hours - I doubt 95% of owners will ever run the battery dry.The kit includes the solar panel, battery pack, two lights with switches and a lantern.  Additional lights can be purchased - the battery pack supports four lights. The battery pack also has a USB port - this charges the lantern or any other device that can be charged from a USB port. Smart phone, etc.  The battery pack can also be used stand-alone to charge your phone, tablet, etc. Everything hooks up to the battery pack with jacks, so nothing is permanently attached to it.My one complaint/peeve. They have tried to keep everything as simple and reliable as possible. Everything is modular. That means that the wires, distance to switches, battery pack - it's all fixed.  You can loop up extra wire (ugly) or cut and tape (voids warranty.) Same thing with extending the cable.  Apart from that complaint, it's a darn good system.  Most people won't even be bothered by that.The switches are large flaps - push to turn on, again to change brightness, again to turn off. Simple enough.  They are not waterproof, so don't think of using these for outdoors. You can also turn on and off from the battery pack and pre-set the switches to dim or bright. So you can press one button (on the battery) and turn on all the lights.  This essentially gives you a third, master switch.  Hang the pack near the entrance and you have instant light.The battery fully charges from the solar panel in 8 hours. You can also charge it from AC with a 12V (.5 amp minimum) adapter. It's not included (I save all my adapters and found a few that worked.)The pack will power two lights on low power for 15 hours.  It will power one light for over a day.  So in bright sun you could have one light always on.  Hang the lantern on a hook so it's near the charger (and so the included cord reaches the battery pack.)  This way you also have a fully charged lantern.  The lantern does not have a built-in solar panel (d.light makes a model with a built-in solar panel) so needs to be charged.  You can carry this to light your way, or hang it up for an additional light.I'm using this in a storage shed. I also occasionally take road trips and have slept in the bed of my truck or camped out. I'll take this on these trips - no need to kill the truck battery if I need light or have to charge my phone, etc. TL;DR:",

I decided on the shed I have down the garden, I was using an hanging lantern but not really that efficient or enough light.  Anyway easy to set this up, you basically put the solar panel where there is a lot of sun (in my case on the roof of the shed) then run the cord down and plug it into the control unit (the single socket on one side) and then plug in the 2 fixed lamps into any of the 4 sockets and wait for the sun to do it's work.This is where I have the problem, I am in WA so sun is not readily available this time of year but surprisingly after about a day I managed to get both lamps running and for the time I needed.  There is also a lantern included which you can also charge with the control unit.  The lantern is portable so great for walking back and forth when it is getting dark.I now pop in the shed whenever I want and I have all the light I need.  The 2 fixed lamps have switches so can be turned off and on and the lantern is the same.  One night I left everything on to see how good this was and next day the lights were still working.  You can also buy 2 extra fixed lamps because this has 4 sockets.  Also with this kit you don't necessarily need sun, you can just charge the control unit by putting a 12v 0.5A power adapter into the solar panel socket.The control unit also has a USB so you could use this for charging other devices like cell phones etc.  This would work really well if you were camping, you set everything up, have plenty of light and you can charge your devices.Build quality is decent, the solar panel and control unit are excellent.  The fixed lamps and lantern are plastic but sturdy enough.I like the idea of this kit and a new one for me, I  have never done anything solar before so a great experiment and a successful one too.  Great for outbuildings but I can certainly see a lot of campers going for this too. TL;DR:",

They're good for what they do but ultimate you have a simple row of LEDs being fed some solar juice; it's not really a true solution akin to hardwiring real lights in your shed, garage, sun room etc.The (strangely named) d.light D20 however is about as close to running a physical line without needing the know how or dangers involved with such a project. There's a separate power source, switches, hanging lights and even a central station for controlling it independently as well as charging almost any USB devices.A little advanced planning in terms of solar panel placement is recommended, but it's not huge so can be screwed in anywhere. Then it's a simply case of finding nice spots for the switches and lights themselves. Everything is plug and go, no wire cutting needed and since it's all lower powered via DC you cannot get shocked even if you decide you need to splice in a few extra feet (although will invalidate the warranty).I placed this in my exterior double car garage, which is really a glorified shed. It's not in it's final location so I wanted something semi temporary that required no connection to the house electricity. Installation was super easy- mounted the solar panel, connected and hung the lamps, the main station and finally then ran the switches. Afterwards I stapled the wiring to make it neat and tidy and looped any extra wiring and tucked it away. Professional job in less time than it took to find the tools to do it.The next evening, after a good few hours of sun, I got to enjoy stepping into the shed without reaching for my flashlight. Of course, a five watt solar panel cannot in anyway compare to a fluorescent light running 120V in terms of brightness but you know, it's perfectly acceptable and the added bonus of a charging station and a lantern is the icing of this solar powerd cake.Requires little to no experience of doing such a project and the results speak for themselves.

They tend to be a good bit more expensive but I'm not really wanting that around my free range chickens.  I've used the Miracle Grow Shake 'N Feed for a few years now with good results.For what it is worth, it compares almost as well as frequent, sparse natural chicken poop.  I've got knockout roses where my chickens hide under it and then the same roses of the same age in the same soil outside the fence that are never visited by the birds.I put this product around and under the roses that are OUTSIDE the fence.  The roses with this bloom just as beautifully and are lush and healthy, though just not quite as big as the ones that get the continual chicken tending.  This tells me that the nitrogen content is very much what a rose wants and needs to really turn on the blooms and produce the foliage.It's easy to apply- I love the new lid which keeps you from dumping the product out too fast.  The pellets come out and go over the cap and it helps distribute it.  Generally with my 5 large knockouts, 2 climbers, and an Old English Rose, I can get through the Southern (long) growing season with just one jug.If, however, you grow more finicky tea roses and/or have problems with aphids, Japanese beetles, or other bugs, and have no reason not to use it, you might prefer the food with the systemic insect and disease control in it.I grow sedum, snapdragons, coleus, fennel, and begonias around my roses and they get this and seem to like it as well.  It has never hurt any of my flowers.  My mini-roses are in the same beds and they like it every bit as much as the larger roses do- just watch that you don't over apply it - there's a picture on the jug showing how it should look on the ground if applied right - it's a great guide and easy to compare just with sight.  The main thing is - don't dump it or clump it- scatter it thinly.I also put mine out before I know it's going to rain.  By the end of the week, I'll have tons of blooms. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I have found that a lot of people get confused by the different types of fertilizers and the hype that surrounds them so here is a quick guide.This Shake 'N Feed is a granular, slow-release fertilizer. Every time it rains or you water your plants. some of the fertilizer will dissolve in the water and feed the plants. The main advantage is that it feeds continuously and evenly over several months as long as they get water. Also keep in mind that too much water, from say a flooding rain will dilute the soil and you will need to reapply a little earlier.Liquid fertilizer, like regular Miracle-Gro has a more immediate effect. Since it is already in water, it is absorbed quickly to give the plants a burst of energy. Plants that bloom continuously like Hibiscus need this and fruit and vegetables that are setting fruit do too.Organic fertilizer comes in both versions above and also include compost which it very slow release, as it has to rot to be useful to the plants.The most important thing to remember is that this isn't a one or the other thing, you can use all of the above as required. Different plants have different needs at different times. Just as you might eat an orange every morning for vitamin C, but take a mega dose vitamin C pill when you feel a cold coming on, the same concept works in your garden. You should use compost to keep your soil healthy year round, use this Shake 'N Feed fertilizer when the plants fist bud in the spring, enter the heat of summer and start to go dormant in the fall and use liquid fertilizer to give them a boost when blooming, fruiting or when bugs or disease threatens them.Remember the best defense against garden pests and disease is having healthy plants.

Vine expects reviews to be done within thirty days, which has not been a sufficient amount of time for me to judge the efficacy of this product in promoting flowery growth.  So that part of the review will have to wait for later.I applied this product to two Spathiphyllum plants that are about ten years old.  The plants are generally robust, but were looking a bit tired.  I was impressed with how quickly they greened up to a nice dark green within just a few days of the application of this plant food.  They have not bloomed well in quite a while now, so it will be interesting to see if this product helps in that regard.I also like the dispenser very much.  It has been updated from the old style pouring spout style that all too easily dumped a pile of plant food instead of allowing it to be evenly dispersed.  The design of this dispenser causes the plant food to be distributed with the particles spaced away from each other, as the directions indicate should be done.  Very cool design.  I like it a lot.The one thing that I did not like about the container, however, was the lack of an NPK rating in big numbers on the front of the label.  The analysis is 9-18-9. The rating is what I always look for when shopping for plant food.  These numbers are only found in small numbers on the back label.  Due to the lack of prominent numbers on the front label, I would have probably passed right by this product if shopping for plant food in the garden department of a store. Hence the four stars instead of five.Looks to be a good product overall.Update, June, 2014:I can't say that this product did anything to help my Spathiphyllum plants to bloom.  To be fair, however, these are indoor plants, and variables such as air temperature and ambient light also impact their growth and bloom cycles.  BUT, I also put Shake 'N Feed on my potted outdoor geranium plants a few months ago, and they are absolutely going nuts with flowers.Therefore, I can recommend this product with confidence. TL;DR:",

It would also dispense safflower seed very well, which squirrels don't like (although it's really not #1 on the hit parade for most birds, either).

Each and every one is constantly raided by our plethora of squirrels.  The plastic of the feeders is chewed apart by the squirrels, most of the seed goes to them, and the rest they find ways to jump on the feeders to spill the seeds on the ground where they all can gather with ease.The design of the Perky-Pet includes an Umbrella type cover that attaches loosely to the hanger.  It is meant to be loose so that if a squirrel or other mean, old seed predator tries to jump on top, it simply tips to the side and they fall off.  It does do that...the squirrels have failed in every attempt to gain access.  However, in any breeze, that same umbrella top flips around, up and down, from side to side, and scares the birds off!As a result, after 2 weeks of hanging in a tree, nary a seed is gone.  Guess it will help save costs of seed, but I am hoping the birds adjust to it soon.UPDATED POST:I am going to have to locate a spot completely out of the wind for this feeder.  Calm, almost windless day today and the birds are all over it.  Meanwhile, the squirrels keep trying and it is fun watching them become dive-bombers to the ground.  I have secluded spots to place it, but the only trouble is it's out of sight from any window, and is not where we can enjoy seeing the birds feeding.FINAL UPDATE:This feeder is never going to be worthwhile.  It needed to be removed from any area that had wind, even light breezes, and we did that.  Unfortunately, birds like to feed where there is cover and the only place this could be mounted was in a small niche in the house side.  No birds came to feed.

My yard has the usual birds that don't seem to migrate in winter around here: cardinals, robins, titmice and chickadees.  So far, they have had no problems visiting the feeder.

In fact, the only birds who even bother with this feeder in my backyard are those nuisance starlings and grackles.Depending on what I filled it with during my 6 week testing period - seed, suet, peanut nuggets or mealworms - the platform feeder did attract a few species of wild birds at first.  As a full-time resident of the Gulf coast of west central Florida where the birdlife is unusually rich and abundant, I have identified many species at my other bird feeders but only the starlings and grackles continued to visit this platform feeder, especially when I filled it with peanut nuggets or mealworms. (The squirrels, by the way, do not like the mealworms).I positioned my feeder in a nearby tree using a 36-inch \"S\" branch-hook which provides a lot of clearance around the feeder to foil the squirrels. The adjustable dome is designed to wobble and throw the squirrels off balance when they attempt a raid but my squirrels still manage to get under it, tilt the feeder and spill the food. I don't mind this too much though because I also enjoy watching the birds ground feed.The Perky-Pet platform feeder is made in China and requires some assembly. It is easy to assemble but the wire grate that fits overs the metal feeding dish is warped on my unit and is a very poor fit, leaving about a half inch gap allowing the squirrels a better foothold and easier access to the food. I have since removed this grate inasmuch as it serves no good purpose.The distance between the dome and the feeding dish is adjustable but the dome is also a poor fit and sits at an angle, wobbling and bouncing wildly on its spring with the slightest movement of air. It is not a bad looking feeder but I would visually like it better if all of its pieces were a straighter fit and the feeder didn't look so wonky.The feeder requires frequent cleaning which means dismantling the feeder. It's a bit of a hassle to disassemble the feeder twice a week but necessary to prevent disease transmission in birds through decayed and contaminated food.But during the process of frequent disassembling, cleaning and reassembling, I've done a little experimenting with this feeder trying to make it a more successful feeder for wild birds and this is what I've discovered:1. The grate really is useless so I just keep it off.2. The bouncing dome does not deter squirrels. Rather it scares the birds away. So I tried keeping the dome off in order to attract more birds. This didn't really work for attracting desirable birds other than nuisance birds. I also discovered that the dome is actually beneficial for keeping the feed protected from the elements and bird droppings. So I decided to continue using it.3. The dome does work better when I reassemble the feeder without using the spring. The dome wobbles much less and is more steady without the spring and therefore doesn't frighten the birds with that frantic wobbling.After all this tweaking I'm still not satisfied with this Perky Pet feeder. I most definitely would not buy another. Nor would I ever recommend it. In fact, mine has gone in the trash.If you really want a squirrel proof wild bird feeder I highly recommend theBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic. Bromes are expensive but they are worth every penny. My Brome feeders paid for themselves in no time, just by what they save me in all the birdfeed that the squirrels cannot access. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I'm sorry, I'm a nice guy and I don't like to trash anyone products or ideas, but this feeder, while cute and fairly well made, has a lot of issue that prevent it from being a truly useful feeder. But read on because I also found a good use for it.First, let me tell you how to prevent squirrels in your feeders 100-percent of the time. I've been feeding birds for decades (I'm not going to say how many decades, lol) and while I have tons of gray squirrels on my property, none of them get to my feeders unless I want them to get there (and I do allow them to get to one of my tray feeders, particularly in cold winters). Squirrels can only jump approximately four vertical feet and a little more than that horizontally. So, if you go to a bird-feeder/wildlife supplies store, or your local home store, and buy a say, 8' of metal piping and plant it in the ground (bird feeder stores, if you have one nearby, have a cool tool for this that makes the job ultra easy), you can place a baffle on the pipe just over four feet off the ground and the squirrels will *not* get past it. Then you can put a double or triple shepherd's hook at the top and hang several feeders. I have a 2' x 2' open tray feeder on another pole filled to the brim and no squirrel has ever feasted there. So what you need is a pole, a baffle and some kind of hooks at the top for hanging feeders: all of this is available in a bird-feeding store (I won't mention the chain name here because Amazon will take it out--but it has \"wild\" in the name). (Squirrels *can* jump downward amazing heights, by the way, so you must be careful not to be under a tree limb--I've seen squirrels drop 20 feet vertically.)As far as this feeder goes. First of all, the dome is great for keeping the birds and seed a bit dryer, but it's not going to deter any squirrels. Five mins after the first squirrel got onto this feeder (and I hung it under a tree limb so that he could get there), he hung by his back paws from the loop and swung himself down. Mission accomplished.Also, the description says this hold 3.5 lbs of seed--hah, in someone's dreams. This hardly holds anything. A half pound if you're lucky. The feeder tray is only 9.5-inches across and less than an inch deep.OK, all of that said, there are uses for this feeder and, as I said, it's a cute feeder, pretty nicely made. As at least one other reviewer stated this make a good thistle (niger) feeder--excellent, in fact (some seed does drip out the drain holes, but that can't be avoided). But small finches do have trouble getting their beaks through the grating, so I removed it. I just fill the tray with thistle and they sit on the edge and it works just fine.In it's own way, I kind of find the feeder useful, now the goldfinches have their own little feeder and since squirrels don't like that type of seed, the barely pay it any mind. This feeder is not what it says it is, it's not a squirrel warrior, but it's kind of pretty and I'm sure you can find uses for it. Ironically, if you took off the dome and got rid of the grid, you could fill it with peanuts and feed the squirrels. Or, if you have fruit-eating birds like Baltimore Orioles, you can place orange sections in it. Nothing beats seeing an Oriole at the feeder! If you want to buy the best bird feeders around, look at Droll Yankee. I've probably spent a thousand dollars on feeders over the years and theirs last forever. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "A fine little feeder, but the plastic baffle is worse than useless.The base and rod are sturdy metal construction. The baffle and the mechanism that holds it in place are all plastic. I had several problems with the baffle:* The baffle sits on top of a spring, which makes it wobble continuously, even in a light breeze (rather than being weight activated like most anti-squirrel baffles). The wobbling made birds visibly nervous, even though it was placed at several times the height of the tufted titmouses that were the first visitors.* In windy conditions, that wobbling gets worse (you can hear it bonking around from inside). The wobbling makes the baffle work its way downwards. After one 24-hour spell of typically windy mid-Atlantic Spring weather, the baffle had worked its way all the way down to the base of the feeder. The plastic mechanism that holds it in place had been tightened fully just two days before. I tested it afterwards (it was still tight) but I found steady pressure would make the baffle move-- which is what the wind-storm had done.* The baffle doesn't keep squirrels off, at least not when hanging from a post. The squirrel just climbs up the post, and then side-steps or leaps onto the feeder (bypassing the baffle).  My squirrels figured this out the very first day the feeder was out.So, the baffle is now permanently off, and I'll only use the feeder when I don't mind squirrels eating from it also (the grate doesn't prevent their access in any way). Also, this feeder is on the small side-- it takes less black oiler sunflower than I'd use in a short tube feeder.Other thoughts: Without the baffle, it's easy to dump out any leftover seed or other cruft stuck under the grate (with the baffle, it's awkward to do so). With no real squirrel-proofing and considering the limited capacity, the feeder could be cheaper. The included directions are fairly useless-- I wish companies would take a lesson from IKEA with its clear, simple diagrams. Fortunately the assembly is much easier than the directions make it out to be.With its sturdy metal construction (and no baffle), this feeder works reasonably well, but it's not anything special. If you just need a simple hanging feeder, there are a lot of other designs out there. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "*NOTE*--I still love this feeder and it's still the #1 feeder that our finches go to but I needed to tweak things about it to have it function well. The first problem addressed was that on windy days, the constant bobbling of the dome caused the seed pan to shake itself free from the nut on the stainless pole, causing the entire pan to fall down! Now, if you've ever tried to find a 1/4\" silver nut in the snow, you know the problem! I had to buy a package of them at the hardware store since no one sells just \"one\". Nothing we did to tighten the new nuts worked, so ultimately, to avoid the pan from constantly coming undone, we Crazy Glued the nut in place and that's worked beautifully! Since every other feeder we own has a rigid \"in place\" feeder platform that can't be removed, I had no qualms with making our feeder tray permanently attached to the pole. 2) The second problem we encountered was with that metal screen. I'm not really sure what the purpose of it was but we noticed that it acted as a deterrent to the birds trying to get seeds out of the pan. Peanuts are NOT \"one size fits all\" so the larger nuts would stay stuck in the pan, with NO ability for the birds to wrangle them out. So, before we glued the nut to the steel hook, we removed the metal tray and now EVERYONE'S HAPPY!This feeder is the star of our garden and before any other feeder fills with birds, this one is always at maximum capacity. It even held up to 30 mile per hour winds during our latest \"Spring\" snow storms. We're delighted that we got this feeder for our fine-feathered friends. :DAnd now, the bottom is from my original review:My husband and I live in very rural Michigan, right along Lake Michigan's flight path for birds. We have an exceedingly healthy and abundant Winter population of \"The Usual Suspect's\": Cardinals, Goldfinches, House Finches, many Sparrow species, Doves, Bluejays, Titmouse, various Woodpeckers and Junco's. On our acre of land, we have 13 feeding stations set up, both for our enjoyment from many different windows but also to prevent fighting. (and as a parent, we ALL know that \"kids fight!\")I own many Perky-Pet feeders and they are beautifully made and crafted. We do NOT have a squirrel problem out here, simply because there's so much wild land for them to feed and frolic. This new feeder is a much needed and much welcomed addition to our garden, catering exclusively to whatever size bird you choose to gift with the contents of the feeder.Set up was a breeze! Oh, how I love companies that really, truly KNOW how to write instructions! With the clear plastic dome, the entire feeder is a Thing of Beauty, and I was a bit sad, putting it into the elements where I know within 24 hours, it will be on it's way to productive shabbiness. But, such is life. LOLWe LOVE the adjustable height of the dome! We really, really LOVE that drainage holes have been place on the feeder tray so the seeds don't end up swimming in rain water...NICE TOUCH, Perky Pets! We even loved the Q.R. code on the packaging, which led us to Perky Pets Youtube site, so we could revel in their other feeders and see not only the designs we do and do not own but how the feeders should look when actively used.Perhaps it's because of the sheer volume of birds that come to our feeders, but we had zero problems attracting featured birds to this feeder. The first, of course, was our bold friend, the Blue Jay! Thoroughly happy with being the ONLY bird at this new feeder, he didn't even care to announce to his cronies that \"Hey, Jays! There's a new feeder here...with PEANUTS!!!!\" He happily gorged himself on 28 peanuts (yes, we counted!), and then finally flew away. Minutes later, a Titmouse showed up, and apparently having better manners than Mr. Jay, he announced to his relatives that \"Peanuts! Peanuts!\" were being now served at our Country Cottage, and the feeder was filled within minutes with 8 Titmouse. :D Over the course of a day, everyone came and enjoyed themselves, but none more than my husband and I.The peanuts we buy are very dear in price: a dollar a pound. So, we put them out very sparingly, simply because we don't want to take on another job to simply buy those peanuts! With this feeder, NOTHING goes to waste and I notice they don't even scatter upon the ground. This is an attractive, jolly and very economical way for us to feed our feathered friends the most expensive of feeds and enjoy their antics as our payment.I love when a company makes such a stand out product that TRULY functions, as advertised!

        "reviewText": "Update, April 2014:  My original three-star review is posted below. I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there's good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren't as good as I'd hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can't comment on that yet. TL;DR:",

And one of the things we've learned is that almost EVERYTHING needs to be \"scaled down\" in size, for Urban Use, whether it's a patio set that only seats 2 people vs. 8 people; a small grill that can handle a couple of burgers vs. a side of beef, and even bird feeders...yes, even bird feeders.Out in the country, we have 14 feeders, ranging from multiples of suet feeders, feeding platform feeders, tube feeders and thistle feeders. Nary a pigeon, rat nor squirrel in sight, we don't have the problems of feeding birds that plagues Urban gardens.That's why, when I received this feeder, I instantly thought: BALCONY!!!, and that's indeed where it has ended up. Anyone who's ever lived in the city with a balcony knows ALL the problems: too small of a space, too shallow, usually metal railings that support nothing and slats of boards for floors so the 3rd floor is always messing up the 2nd and 1st floor balconies.THIS feeder is just PERFECT for small urban spaces, either vertical (condo) or horizontal (home) which still have no trees in their own garden, due to lack of space. Yes, it can be hung by it's sturdy and handy swivel latch, but it also has a very, very nice key-hole cut out on the back, making it perfect to hang from a simple nail against a wood balcony wall. And since it's so simple to open up the patio door and refill this feeder, it's small size is perfect for filling every other day.We've had NO problems with this feeder. Our metal top, unlike so many other's, fits tightly and snugly...there simply is NO gap between the top and clear walls. For the type of birds we're attracting: Mourning Doves/Chickadees/Finches/and Sparrows, the ample metal perch and strong seed catcher holds every bird that lands. We're lucky, in that a crab apple tree is directly outside of our condo window, so the birds have perched on our porch, forever. We've also had small metal trays of food on our tiny patio table, so they were used to coming to our home for food.We love this feeder. It's definitely a \"niche\" category; I wouldn't use it in a suburban or rural area, simply because there's too many birds that visit those yards and the shape and limited capacity would/could make this problematic. Much larger feeding tubes and platform feeders are the ones that work out there.But, for people who live in tiny spaces that LOVE birds and want to attract them, THIS is a wonderfully thought out feeder. If you have a relative or friend in assisted living, this feeder would be a welcome gift to have outside of their window to enjoy.Bottom line: Our feathered friends HIGHLY recommend it!

The top part has a hook already attached, and there is a bottom tray type part which allows the birds (and likely other small wild critters) to perch.  According to the instructions, the holes allow rain to come through and collect, after being filtered and holds up to 64 ounces of water.So far, it has stayed on the tree outside my window without a problem.  The Perky Pet Feeder I had tended to bobble around a lot in a strong wind, but since I will be using this during the summer, that probably won't be an issue.  Since the standing bird baths I have had tend to collect dirt and need to be tipped regularly to prevent mosquitos from breeding, the hanging feeder should be a good alternative.

        "reviewText": "This is a plastic water reservoir and tray designed to provide liquid refreshment for wild birds. It weighs 10 oz empty, and holds 2 quarts of water. It stands about 10&#8221; high and is 8&#8221; in diameter. The top is plastic mesh, allowing the reservoir to be filled from the top, or to be refilled by rainwater. The waterer includes a metal hanger on the top lid to the reservoir. The design allows water to trickle continuously from the reservoir to keep the lower tray full at all times. The lower tray has toe holds on the edges for birds to perch on.I hung my waterer in my back yard, which is generally filled with wild songbirds. In addition to feeders, I also keep a self-standing birdbath in the yard. The waterer hung for a week in a bush near both the feeders and the birdbath, but no birds made use of it during that time. Then I had to move my feeders indoors because wild bears were seen in the neighborhood stealing from bird feeders. I figured this waterer would be safe to leave out despite the bears because it did not contain any food, and did not smell like food. But I was wrong. Bears are smart&#8212;the next night they went straight for this waterer because it looks like a feeder and hangs like one. A bear cub walked right up to the waterer, took a sip from the edge, then tore the waterer apart. I also had problems with leakage with this waterer&#8212;if the waterer doesn't stay completely level, then water drips over the edge of the bottom tray, and the reservoir slowly empties onto the ground (it can completely empty in as little as 15 minutes). Even if you manage to hang it so that it is exactly level, a gusty breeze can tip it; I found half the water gone after a windy night. What I can I say? Perhaps this waterer might work in urban environments where there are no bears and birds are really thirsty and you don't have much wind. But if you live in an area where bears are a problem, a self-standing birdbath might be a safer bet since bears don't expect to find food in them. TL;DR:",

Great idea!The problem is that this thing simply doesn't hold water--even when it's perfectly level. I tested it in my kitchen sink and filled it with water and left it on bottom of the sink and came back a while later (like a half hour) and it was completely empty.

However, I have now experienced more of the problems that some of the other reviewers encountered, and this waterer is pretty much useless to me.  When I filled the empty container this morning, I apparently did not have it centered right on the hook, and water spilled out continuously.  I tried twice to recenter it, but could not get it laser-level even, and it spilled until it was completely empty.  No wind today.  Don't the designers actually test these things??~~~~~~~I like the idea of this bird waterer.  The birds have not used it yet, but I think they probably will as weather gets hotter and water gets scarcer.  Previous to getting this, I used a hummingbird feeder as a waterer, but that, of course, limits the kinds of birds that can use it.  (The feeder leaked, and I didn't want sugar water on the ground attracting ants, but a little water leaking was okay.)So, this product should have been ideal.  And it would have been had it been better designed and made.The reservoir is quite large, and when I am filling it and holding it by the saucer underneath, the saucer is so flimsy that I'm afraid it is going to break.I couldn't carry it outside without spilling on the floor between the kitchen and back door.  The saucer is too shallow.  I know that birds like shallow water, but the sides still could have been made higher.  There is no lip or anything that helps keep the water from sloshing out.The waterer is hung on my patio, sheltered from most sun and most wind, but still gets a little of both.  The slightest breeze causes it to spill, emptying it in short order.  The saucer is so shallow that I can't even climb onto the chair I use to reach the hook without spilling water, usually down the front of whatever I am wearing.The top is perforated, supposedly to let in rainwater as well as making filling easy.  What it does more often, in this land of little rain, is let in tiny bugs.The reservoir is frosted plastic, but I can't find information on what kind of plastic it is.  I would prefer glass or plastic that is safe for water bottles.  I don't know if this plastic is harmful to birds.It is easy to clean, and the reservoir does hold quite a bit of water.  A smaller reservoir that didn't spill so easily would be a better idea.  I looked at some of the other waterers available, and several have different reservoirs but the same too-shallow saucer underneath.Given the negatives, this feeder with a patio light shining behind it in the evenings makes a very pretty glow.  The birds don't seem to care, though. TL;DR:",

It's both easy to top-off and self-filling (with rain water) through the perforated top. A flow limiter keeps the reservoir from just pouring out the bottom.So what's to not like? Unfortunately, a lot. For one, the bottom is too shallow to hold much water. Combined with the swaying motion of the waterer in the wind (or its wobble when first hung), water dribbles/drips over the edge steadily, leaving an empty unit after a day or two. It's possible the flow limiter isn't working right either, and allowing the pressure of the reservoir's contents to overfill the tray.The platforms edge also seems too shallow/rounded for birds to grip and land-- the design looks like it might have been modeled after a hummingbird feeder (they don't generally land when they feed).Worst of all, I didn't observe any birds using the unit. Maybe they were just nervous about the new unit-- but they didn't shy away from the feeder on the same post, and did patronize the nearbydeck-mount birdbath(since discontinued, but my favorite). Maybe \"puddle in a tree\" isn't natural for my birds? I even tried the waterer at my mother's house (she's an expert birder), with a different population of birds. No luck there either-- and she tried moving it to different locations and hanging arrangements in a futile effort to get birds to drink from this unit.Finally, the top doesn't close tight unless you try (hold the top and lift/turn the bottom)-- otherwise it's just a slight turn, and it doesn't lock into place at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the waterer twisting in the wind works its way loose and comes apart periodically.I was able to easily fill the unit with a watering can, though a piece or two of leaf had already worked its way into the reservoir the first week of use. It would likely need to be cleaned out periodically. The bottom tray also gathered small leaves in the same week (non-autumn).A good idea, but this implementation is badly flawed. TL;DR:",

The streak has been broken with this.A waterer is a great idea, especially here in the dry west.  I was excited to have a chance to test this unit, but I began to get the &#34;uh-oh&#34; feeling almost immediately.  It has a snap-together construction--nothing particularly bad about the idea--but I found that it was very easy to snap the bowl/perch area right off the feeder.  The weight of a jay (a common bird here) would have been enough to snap it right off: that is if water had stayed in it long enough to attract that jay.This unit is extremely sensitive to orientation.  Any tilt--no matter how slight--will be sufficient to drain it dry.  This might be fine on a windless, airless planet.  But here on earth, the smallest breeze was enough to knock it out of the vertical.  I could see the water dribbling out, and it only took about 15 minutes for the thing to be completely empty.  There were no evident flaws in construction.  This is a problem of design.It's top-fillable without disassembly.  The idea is to catch rainwater--a noble idea.  But try filling it from a jug.  It only accepts a slow flow of water and you have to stand there dribbling in the water for several minutes.  I think it drains faster than it fills.  Perky-Pet needs to head back to the drawing board (or directly to the bin) with this unit.  It's a great idea, but this implementation fails completely. TL;DR:",

I'm not too keen on how the saucer connects to the bottom part of the container. If you don't put it together just right, the saucer will fall off when the weight of the water hits it. Other reviewers have stated that the waterer is empty over night. I have a feeling that's due to the issue I just mentioned; it's difficult to get it attached properly and I think the water just drains out. When I DO get it right, it works fine. Also due to its lightweight material, it will sway and empty more quickly on windy days.I like the capacity. I've seen up to four birds (finches, wrens, black capped chickadees...smaller birds) sit and drink from it. I've not seen anyone try to bathe in it yet:) ~ bought this specifically for my front yard. I have a feeder or two that I want to keep the birds at. However they tend to go to our back feeders, where our birdbath is located. I thought this would do the trick to keep some birds in front and some birds in back. It suits my purpose. All in all, it's okay, but I think they construction could have used a bit more thought/common sense, and I don't believe it would have increased the cost by much, if at all.

The two chairs were stacked, and were very well packaged and padded, so they came without a scratch.Appearance: The first thing that I noticed when I unwrapped the chairs is that there was some dimpling along the arms of the chairs. I presume that this was from the manufacturing process, when the metal for the arms was bent into shape. The dimpling is not bad, and does not seem to distract from the look of the chairs. Indeed, one doesn&#8217;t expect outdoor chairs to be works of art.That said, though, they are quite attractive chairs, and look great on my deck.Feel: The chairs are nice and comfortable with the webbing for the seat and back hitting in the right spots. Indeed, these are much more comfortable than my old chairs!Construction: The chairs are of a sturdy construction and give you a good feeling of support. I also get the feeling that they will last a good long time. Their weight is about the same as my old chairs, which means that I can easily carry one a long way, or move two around the yard.Conclusion: I think that these are great chairs, and I am very glad that I have them.

Sensing that these would make nice chairs to use with the picnic table, I snatched them up.The chairs came double packaged in a large cardboard box, with the chair nested in one protective box, and then that box inserted into a second, heavier, well-taped box. Both chairs arrived safe, sound, and unblemished. Although the chairs are of a light, sturdy aluminum make, two stacked together in cardboard are still pretty heavy, so some buyers may want to be home when these are delivered so they get put where you want.The wife and I both love the look of the chairs. They are extremely comfortable, and mesh fabric gives them a strong but airy feel. The arm rests are nicely positioned, and the whole frame has a slight amount of flex to give the chairs a little more of a cushiony feel. The color is nice and will go with just about any outdoor d&eacute;cor. And they are comfortable (did I say that?). Although we haven't sat in them for any appreciable amount of time, I'm confident we'll be able to relax and lounge on our deck with these for some time to come.

Two days later I was sitting at my desk (home office) and I heard this big truck rumbling outside--and they were delivering a giant box to my neighbor. He's a cabinet builder and I just assumed he had ordered another table saw or some other large tool and I watched the truck driver carefully moving this really really big box into his driveway. I thought nothing of it except that the box was *really* big. That night around midnight I went to my front door to see if the snow had begun (I live in Connecticut, we're had a wicked winter) and there was the giant box: in MY driveway! Apparently the driver had put it in the wrong driveway, realized his mistake and moved it to mine. So at midnight I went out in single-digits weather and somehow managed to slide the box up my steps and into my living room alone. (It really wasn't heavy at all, just awkward.) Anyway, as soon as I saw the Amazon label I knew what was in the box.The surprise was that these chairs were shipped fully assembled! I was shocked. I had assumed I'd be sitting around one day with a screwdriver and putting these together myself, but these were completely and beautifully assembled--and they were shipped one nested inside the other. And whoever designed the packaging and whoever packed these chairs deserves a bonus for hard work. These chairs were lovingly and carefully packaged and they slid right out of the bottom of the box with ease. The cats were thrilled at having such a big empty box to play in.The Chairs: As far as the quality of these chairs, they are extremely well crafted and very attractive. The frames (they are double-framed under the seat portion) are extremely strong and they are larger (wider) than a normal lawn chair I think. At least it seems that way. I am not a small person (I'm a little on the wide side, too, lol) and the chairs have plenty of room left over and they are super strong. The woven seat is flexible, it gives a bit when you sit in it (as it should) but the frames are solid as a rock. The backs of the chairs are nicely angled, very comfortable and tall enough to offer good back support.Of course, it's still winter outside here, so the chairs are living in my den for the moment, but I can't wait to put them out in the garden. They're so pretty that I've actually considered using them as indoor/outdoor furniture in my screened porch, but it will be nice to have a solid, very comfortable chair outdoors, so the garden is where they are headed.I've looked at a lot of lawn furniture over the years and these chairs are as well built (or better) as anything I've seen. And I think considering their strength and quality, the price is reasonable.By the way, the cats loved having the giant box for a few days as a castle, but I eventually had to take it away from them.

These chairs are made of a very sturdy aluminum which is powder coated in gray. This means they are totally weather resistant and rust free. The backs and seats are made of a very sturdy tightly woven breathable plastic in colors of gray, tans and beiges. You can leave these outdoors all the time, as the aluminum doesn't rust and the woven seat and back dries quickly being plastic and not fabric.These Sling Chairs are totally one solid piece- non movable parts and stackable for easy storage.  They are very sturdy and supportive and with their high back being 2 feet high from the seat to the top of the back- this gives you full total back support. The seat height from the ground is 18 1/2 inches. The average seat height is 18 inches and for taller people- 19 inches. So, you also get great support for the legs with the seat not being low to the ground. The front seat edge is also curved so the back of your legs get great comfort and not a sharp edge.We have been sitting in these chairs for long periods of time and find pure comfort and support for your back and legs. When they get wet, they dry quickly naturally being made of a tightly woven plastic and aluminum. This makes them very low maintenance. Being stackable, they are easy to put away and take up minimal space in your storage area. The gray/tan/beige colors and sleek design make them very stylish for your yard or patio.These chairs are shipped 2 in a box and are very well padded and protected. The double box is very thick and heavy, but once you unwrap them, the chairs, although very strong and sturdy, are lighter than they look. If you want low maintenance, rust proof, weather resistant, stackable, comfortable, supportive and beautifully stylish chairs for your yard or patio, this set of 5 Star Sling Chairs is for you.

That cast iron usually rusts through within about a year-and-a-half, and the cover extends that to about 2.5 years.  I am storing ours inside from now on as a result.Anyway, this guy has a pretty shallow, small bowl, about the right size to cook a small bit of hamburgers or hot dogs, but if you're looking for a larger fire that will last the evening, you'll be adding firewood frequently.  I still prefer our other one better - you can load a ton of wood (well, almost!) in it and it just burns forever.  This is nice if you just want a short fire for s'mores or for a chilly fall evening.Overall, it's nice, but if you're looking for something to take camping, you'll probably want to look elsewhere - this guy is pretty small and shallow and well, if you're going hunting with the guys over the weekend, they'd probably laugh at this.

The stainless steel legs attach with the supplied bolts. There is a flat steel wrench included. The spark arrestor cover's handle has to be bolted on, the included wrench does not fit that bolt - hand tight is probably good enough for that handle.

The teeth in the bottom dig into the ground and make the pit really stable.I was surprised at how good this looks on a patio or in the yard.

The weather has been mostly quite warm, and I do not have my &#34;chosen spot&#34; prepared for perfect fire pit enjoyment. For reviewing purposes, however, I had to take the first opportunity I had to try it out, at the very least.First I want to say that it is easily assembled and is very sturdy. Also, it is quite attractive in a simple, durable sort of way. I rummaged through my pile wood, provided to me by mother nature over the past months, during some very windy storms. I found enough dry wood and some newspaper and was ready to get started. Since I did not have the time or to be honest the mood to spend hours gazing into the fire on that particular night, I made sure the fire was a small one, and settled in with my (very disinterested) dog to look at fire.Although the timeng was not perfect, I have to say that the short time we spent was relaxing and left me looking forward to having one of those perfect evenings with a fire, and perhaps a friend or two, or maybe a book ( more likely) and my dog, for some quality, relaxing fire time. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to use and review the CobraCo Cast Iron Fire Pit FBCISTEEL. It promises hours of pleasure in the days to come TL;DR:",

This could also be indicative of just a lack of cleanup as the unit was manufactured. Visually, the unit is modern looking with simple, clean lines. The contrast between the matte black basin and the almost chrome finish of the legs is very nice. The basin is not real deep.

It's been a few years since I'd last fertilized my lawn because of the damage done to my lawn with burn spots.It took less than 2/3 of the bag to cover my 1/10 of an acre lawn using a spreader. The yellow color of the pellets made it easy to see just how well it spread and there weren't any clumps to break apart.I'd waited until the grass had already turned green after the harsh winter before applying this, not wanting to confuse what nature would have done on its own with the effectiveness of the fertilizer. There were still some patches left where I thought the grass (and even my green weeds) were dead from last year.Well it's not going to suddenly give you this perfect lawn; that will require more effort on my part.  But the lawn is definitely a richer green and thicker than it had been and the brown patches are smaller and showing more signs of life.No burn spots from this application; a definite plus.Amended:  It's been about 3 weeks since the lawn was fertilized and I can only assume that this is why I've suddenly got a yard full of dandelions after we'd spent a lot of time and effort to eradicate them last year.  I'm making that assumption because most of the rest of the neighborhood, including the next door neighbors, have very little of these weeds.  Perhaps it's best to do a weed and feed before applying the fertilizer.Amended:  It's been two months since the application and wow, my lawn has never looked or felt so good.  The lawn is incredibly thick and there are no brown spots left.  I'm the original owner of this house and have been here for thirteen years.  It's not perfect.

It looked certain it would rain, so I put it down immediately.  I used the guide for my spreader and it only covered about 60% of my front yard.  I have a driveway that bifurcates my front yard in the same proportion, so it was easy to see the difference it would make. And it did rain as expected and about three more moderate rains since then.  In my haste, I forgot that I had already put down some 29-0-10 weed and feed fertilizer in some weed infested areas a couple of weeks prior to this fertilizer application.  To be honest, I haven't seen much of a visible effect after nearly three weeks except for the large spot where I used the weed and feed fertilizer. So it is very likely a cumulative effect of this 10-0-6 fertilizer and the 29-0-10 weed and feed fertilizer that led to the very green grass area.The first number is the amount of available nitrogen, the second number is phosphate and the third number is potash. High nitrogen makes for fast green growth, but not necessarily good plant health.  The potash ingredient is there for overall plant health. The clear majority of the weight is filler - usually about 70%. It is all designed to be highly water soluble to get into the soil - or be washed away into the street gutter and into the groundwater supply.Part of my test result was tainted by the prior high nitrogen weed and feed fertilizer application. But it does illustrate the short term effect of nitrogen for a fast growing green yard (but not necessarily a long term healthy yard). This was the first fertilizer application in well over a year, so my yard was probably nitrogen starved. And it is still very early in the growing season following an unusually cold winter to make an accurate assessment. I lost some St. Augustine grass from fungus last year and some from the winter hard freeze. So I needed some high nitrogen fertilizer initially to spur growth to cover the dead areas. But next I'll drop back to a milder fertilizer like this. TL;DR:",

The next day I thought my eyes are deceiving me it looked a bit greener. Day to I saw yes it is a bit greener. Today is day three I could not believe my eyes it is beautiful. I imagine it will get even better wish I had taken a before picture. I am glad it is zero phosphate and a better for the environment product. No question about it this is what I will be buying from now on. Love no odor and you would pay about $60 here for just one treatment that is toxic and doesn't produce this kind of result. Very happy I tried this product. Not worrying about burning the lawn is a huge plus too. TL;DR:",

SET YOUR CUTTING BLADES HIGHER...............This product has made a visible, positive improvement in the appearance and strength of our lawn:The grass is darker green and more drought resistant.  It is a \"healthier\" lawn, if you will.  The grass is thicker and stronger and crowds out a lot of weeds. In fact, the weeds seem to be repelled. Achieving his lush lawn was relatively simple using a standard fertilizer spreader.This is an organic fertilizer . Here's a brief review of the two major nutrients in lawn fertilizers:Nitrogen (N)Nitrogen is the most important nutrient in lawn fertilization. It helps grow a dense, thick lawn, by stimulating the grass plant growth, and keeps the grass green. This is the lawn food that is depleted most rapidly, but applying too much can create too much top growth and increase the need for mowing.The vivid,  dark emerald green of a lawn can be easily achieved by applying more nitrogen  (caution:  A lot of flowering plants, like peonies, do not want so much nitrogen).Phosphorus (P):Phosphates on the other hand are helpful to strengthen the root system of your lawn. Too much  run-off and leaching of phosphorus used to fertilize lawns can lead to the excessive build-up of algae and weeds in nearby lakes. For that reason, some areas suggest that you limit phosphates in lawn fertilizers to help preserve the local environment and  pose less of a threat to groundwater.  PHOSPHATES MAY EVEN BE ILLEGAL IN SOME AREAS.Mature lawns will have a lower requirement for phosphates.As this fertilizer has 0% PHOSPHATES, It can be a very helpful fertilizer.  Be environmentally friendly, conform to the legal requirements of your local area and still have the best lawn on your block! TL;DR:",

They fully covered my hands and were very effective. While there is snow outside, and I can't test them on the BBQ and/or fire pit, the oven has convinced me that these are safe.A couple of uses I often have - I keep a baking stone in the oven and have been known to turn on the oven before removing it. With these, no problem, just need to put the baking stone on a cookie rack so it doesn't crack. On Thanksgiving, I often forget to remove the &#34;extra&#34; metal shelf in the oven that needs to be moved or removed before I can put the turkey in. I have burned my hands doing this - again, these protect fully making this job possible as well.Since I sometimes don't want or need a full glove, I have also grabbed these and used them as hot pads for a quick pick up of a hot item. Even used this way, the silicone texture makes them much more slip proof.The loops inside work perfectly on the loops I have on my stove to hold hot pads, so they are always ready to go.I am grateful to have received a complimentary set to test so that I could write a review and am happy to be able to give them a good rating.

With temperatures in the single digits lately, I haven&#8217;t been inclined to go outside to grill. What I didn&#8217;t expect was how much I&#8217;d appreciate these gloves for use in my kitchen. I honestly didn&#8217;t believe these would be something I would use much inside, but since I received a pair for review, I decided to try them out with the oven and stove.The first time I used them was while making Chateaubriand. First, I seared it on all sides on the stovetop in my cast iron skillet. The gloves made it easy to handle the cast iron skillet without fear of being burned while also allowing me to handle utensils easily. My pot holders and oven mitts do fine when I want to handle something hot, but it is clumsy trying to handle a cooking utensil while wearing a fingerless oven mitt and using any utensil while holding a pot holder in the same hand is even worse. The Kuisiware gloves&#8217; individual fingers make it easy to hold the pan while stirring, flipping, or performing any other task without need to remove the gloves between each step.I also used them when I cooked asparagus this weekend. I normally seal the asparagus in heavy duty foil, tented a bit on top, and cook it in the oven. While the foil cools quickly, there is still a good bit of steam that escapes when you first open the foil after the asparagus cooks. This was much easier to do while wearing these gloves.I&#8217;ll be using these gloves for most hot kitchen tasks from now on and highly recommend them. The only thing that would make them better in my opinion is if they made them in prettier colors and designs to match my kitchen d&eacute;cor &#8211; or at least so they blend in better. TL;DR:",

When I use hot pads, I sometimes get burns from oven racks as I'm taking something out of the oven; when I use thick oven mitts, I don't have good control for handling pie dishes, muffin pans, or anything else with semi-liquid contents.These heat-resistant gloves made of knitted fabric allow me to use all five fingers (like thick knitted winter gloves) to handle pans or dishes.  The red silicone bands atop the fabric have the feel of rubber, and grip firmly (like rubber).  I can't vouch for the heat resistance up to 662 degrees F., but I do know that the gloves work well when I bake bread in a 465-degree oven, or broil in a 550-degree oven.A nice feature is that one size fits all.  The gloves are a fairly snug fit for my large hands (men's size small), but they seem to have enough remaining stretch to accommodate even larger hands.  The gloves have the same silicone bands on both sides--thus either glove will fit either hand.  There's never any need to locate the \"left\" or \"right\" glove if you're in a hurry.  The gloves are machine washable, but should be laid out flat to air dry.The accompanying literature includes the following warning:  \"Do not use the glove when wet.  It loses its heat-resistant properties.  Do not use on oily, greasy or wet surfaces.  Do not expose the glove to open fire.  Even though the aramid fibers protect the glove from catching on fire, to prong its life and prevent any accidents, keep it away from fire.  Do not let small children use the glove to play with fire.\"Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.

Not only did I find that more comfortable to use, it also made it more efficient &#8211; I could control grasping things easier and could get them off my hands without any problem.The build quality is pretty decent. It&#8217;s all plastic, as expected, but the plastic seems thick enough to stand up to quite a bit of use.

I've used a dust bin and been standing there most of the day trying to push the leaves into the bag before the wind picks them up and scatters them around -- again.  These leaf scoops solve the problem.  With one on each hand, you can get a big scoop of leaves, and the direct them into a bag without spilling.  I've found that I can pick up a big pile of leaves and have them packed into a bag for disposal in two or three minutes.  Comparing that to the frustration of trying to brush them into a bag or lift them with a dust pan -- well, there's just no comparison.When I first saw the size of these scoops, I thought they'd be much too large for me to handle, but that's not the case at all.  I manage them with ease, and after scooping, I pack them away in the nice bag that has been provided with the scoops.I'm delighted with these scoops and the reduction in time I need to clean up all those pesky leaves.

Their &#34;preferences&#34; are for those that are &#34;flat&#34; rather than a hanging jar, and with a ring-type perch. That said, I wanted something like this to hang from an old planter hanger, and this looked like it would fill the bill.First, I do have a leak, and where it drips, it has attracted wasps. Second, the perch is badly made. It was misshapen when I got it, and though I was able to straighten each one out, they are not at the same distance from each &#34;flower.&#34; In other words, if you have one perch centered under a flower, the next one is off a bit, and the one after that off even more. What's with that? Last, I know that Anna's Hummingbirds weigh only a few grams, but these perches are really flimsy.The only species we have year-round is the Anna's, but April is nesting season. While one would think that this would be when mama is hungriest, it has never been the case for our back yard (this is our 16th year of having feeders). We're lucky to get five or six visits a day, and most of those have been males. This is not a criticism of the feeder. I think it will probably attract them as well as any, though I don't think they'll like the perch. (It's only been up for two days.)IF you hang this where the sun will shine on it, the glass will heat up dramatically, and the nectar will have mold within four days. Considering what nectar (or just sugar) costs today, that will add to the cost of feeding these little guys.I'll leave it hanging for a while, but if the hummers don't like that perch (it's easy to tell), I'll go back to the one it's replacing.

        "reviewText": "I've used all sorts of hummingbird feeders over the years and I've probably only 10 or more. The design of this Perky-Pet feeder is really just a duplicate of the standard feeder with all the expected features. This is not, however, to be negative in any way--things become standards because they work. Why re-invent the wheel when you find something that serves its purpose very well?This feeder is easy to fill, though you do feed it by taking off the bottom. I much prefer filling from the top, but that's a very minor issue, you just have to give it a quick flip once you fill it and put the bottom back on. Each of the feeding ports has a built-in bee guard though, to be honest, bees (with this feeder and others) will still try to get some nectar--and sometimes the battles between bees and hummers are kind of exciting. And the top has what they call an \"ant moat\" that prevents ants from getting over the top and getting down to the ports. This feature will only work if you keep the moat filled with water, otherwise, ants can climb right out of it (they are ants after all, they pretty much wander wherever they want.The capacity of the feeder is somewhat minimal, but whether that matters really depends on how many birds you have an how much nectar they eat. If you live in an area that has tons of hummers (like Arizona or Florida) you might want to get a larger capacity feeder. Where I am in New England, as long as I change this and clean it every day or two, it's just fine. Nectar (sugar and water, basically) should be kept fresh anyway because sugar mold forms in old nectar and it is dangerous to the hummingbirds--so, in that respect, smaller is somewhat better, it forces you to clean/refill often.The secret to getting a lot of hummingbirds, I think, is to hang out multiple feeders so that there is less competition, keep the food fresh daily and *wash* the feeders so that the ports run clean, etc. Also, put some red/pink plants nearby to attract the hummingbirds. A big hanging petunia or even an impatient basket will draw them in and help them discover your feeders.

The first feature that I like is the wide opening of the feeder to put your hummingbird nectar in. No more funnels required. Second, I like that it has perches for the birds to sit while they feed. Third, I like that the yellow centers bulge outward slightly and have a smaller grid than most, which may help prevent ants and other bugs from entering the feeder. The Feeder has an &#34;ant trough&#34; or moat around the top to prevent ants from getting into the feeder, but on a hot day, the water you put in there won't last an hour, so I'm not sure how helpful that feature will be.The Feeder does come with a packet of nectar, but here's a helpful hint for you. Make your own for just pennies. Use 1/4 cup white sugar to 1 cup of hot water, stir until the sugar is dissolved completely, then allow to cool to room temperature. I make up a quart at a time because I clean and change food frequently. But don't waste your money buying pre-made nectar packets that include red dyes that are probably not good for the birds anyway.

It appears to do its job, but on hot days the water is sure to evaporate quickly and need multiple refills. I actually prefer our large, clear ant moat that we hang above our hummingbird feeders.

I don't mean just a little leak, I mean red liquid all over the place kind of leak.  At first I thought the birds were just feeding like crazy and that's why the levels were going down... then I saw because it was sitting on a picnic table that the entire table was covered in red gooey sugar water and the feeder had a slow drip.  I'm surprised that Perky Pet would release something like this with a quality problem of this magnitude (it appears other reviewers have experienced this issue as well).  Can't recommend, sorry.ORIGINAL REVIEW:There are lots of great reviews for this feeder already so I'm not sure what I can add, but one thing that I didn't cross my mind when I ordered this large feeder... you have to have a LOT of hummers feeding to consume 30 oz of \"nectar\" before it spoils in the sunlight and heat.  Our hummers are very territorial and fight off others in \"their\" backyard so they can have all the flowers and of course this feeder to themselves.  That results in the nectar going down much more slowly than I would have predicted.As others have stated, this is a great design, with a wide mouth opening on the REAL GLASS (yay!!!) container (dishwasher safe, don't worry about a bottle brush as someone else suggested).  The ant moat seems to work and the bright red color attracts those hummers.  The nectar that comes with this is comically small amount... only 8 oz vs 30 oz capacity of the feeder.  You'll want to make your own with sugar and water (google the recipe) and without any food coloring which is bad for the birds (Amazon also sells clear nectar which is becoming the new norm now).One star off for being cheap with the initial supply of nectar, but overall an excellent feeder that seems design to perform and last.Hope this helps.

It would have been nice to have a hanging chain or cord included, but that's easy to supply.This isn't an artsy artsy piece of garden sculpture to hang and admire; this feeder is designed to appeal to hummingbirds.  I've filled it and hung it, now it's up to the H. Birds. TL;DR:",

With a 30 oz. nectar capacity, this glass hummingbird feeder will assure there's always enough nectar to go around.&#34;...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar for a couple of weeks:What's not to like about this particular Hummingbird Feeder?First of all, the entire unit is very easy to disassemble and re-assemble. The built in ant moat (red top) and base (with the yellow flower-shaped feeding medallions) screw on/off with ease for cleaning and filling with nectar. The yellow flower medallions fit securely into the feeding base without wobbling or falling out.Cleaning the entire unit is a breeze, and takes very little time -- but, one will need a long bottle-brush (I think Perky-Pet sells these) to reach down into the (glass) nectar holder.The nectar reservoir is made of thick/clear glass, the screw on ant moat/holder and base are made of a very sturdy plastic. The colors are bright and cheery and will probably attract more Hummingbirds -- as opposed to more subdued colors, imo.One fills the nectar reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place.  a complimentary packet of  Perky-Pet dry nectar mix is included with this feeder. Easy to mix, and dissolved fast. Just add to 8 oz of water, stir, and pour into feeder. There is no &#34;S&#34; hook included with this feeder for hanging, but there is a place to put one built into the screw on ant moat.  The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!A really nice feature, of this particular Hummingbird feeder, is the built in bee guard. Each of the six yellow feeding medallions has a raised center to keep the bees from reaching the nectar. I am hoping it keeps the wasps and hornets away as well -- as I've seen a few sipping nectar from Hummingbird feeders, in the past, that lack this (wonderful) feature. I don't think it will keep the butterflies off, though, as they have very long tongues. *smiles*The ant moat is just a must have, if ya ask Me. Lots of Hummingbird feeders lack this important innovation. Just put plain tap water in it, after hanging the feeder, and let it do its job of keeping the ants away from the nectar, and the Hummingbirds.The feeding station is encircled by sturdy little perches for the little Hummingbirds to rest on as they feed. btw, it is a lot easier to photograph a Hummingbird that is resting on a perch. ijsThe large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio.*Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder...  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended! Would make a wonderful Gift!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014 TL;DR:",

One reason I like them is that they're affordable, and I've been able to get replacement parts like bee-guards which have kept my older feeders useful and clean.This current Perky-Pet model, the 209B, is really nice. It's got an ant moat at the top and little rails for the Hummers to rest on all the way around.  One of my favorite features though is the ease of cleaning and filling.  Cleaning is particularly important because while making a mess is just my problem (one that can easily be corrected), an unclean feeder can make the birds sick.The wider mouth glass battle on this unit makes filling and cleaning easy.  The glass bottle also threads into the base like a regular bottle/cap arrangement which has kept leakage to a minimum for me.Cleaning the base is easy as the bottom comes apart in two pieces, and I've found that if you take most of the fuzz off of a Q-tip that you can scrub the inside of the flowers, keeping them clear of debris and slimy buildup.The only downside would be the red dye in the sugar Perky Pet supplies. No one recommends food dye any longer. Use it --if you must-- but then use just regular sugar and water to provide nutrition to the birds.  The formula couldn't be easier. 1-cup cooled-boiled water or bottled water (without fizz or chlorine or additives of any sort) and 1/4-cup white regular sugar.  Mix and serve.This is a HUGE feeder, by the way, and I only fill mine with 1-cup of sugar-water because we don't get that many hummers (unfortunately too near the woods) and in the heat of summer it will go bad in a couple of days.  You might want to do the same too.Happy feeding. TL;DR:",

They have many variants in their hummingbird line--some perhaps oriented more toward the humans that hang them than the birds that depend on them--but this one's a winner.  It's more in their classic line (my term, not theirs).  Perky-Pet fiddles with their designs a little bit from year to year.  This year they've widened the mouth of the glass container.  Not only is this easier to fill than previous years, but it's also much easier to clean.  This does mean that you've got to move a little faster when you invert the unit to hang, but the tradeoff is worth it.  There's an ant trap on top (that will dry out in a couple of hours in my climate) and a supposedly bee-resistant flower.  Won't know how well that works until yellow-jacket season arrives.The real test is the birds.  It's the very beginning of hummingbird season in this part of the Rockies, so the birds haven't arrived in numbers.  But it didn't take our first Blackchin more than an hour to find this one.I've only got one complaint and that's the fact that only a small hook is included for hanging.  It's far too small to hang on the wrought-iron hooks than many of us hummer-fanciers prefer.  A short length of chain would have been a better choice. TL;DR:",

We saw this feeder and thought that we would give it a try. Here is what we liked:1. This feeder is VERY easy to clean and to fill!! Some feeders are so small that it is difficult to get a brush up into them to keep them clean. This is very important since a sugar solution in sunlight and heat spoils quickly and can make the birds sick.2. The color definitely attracts them. There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds. The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.  Should also note that the amount of nectar included with this will NOT fill the feeder.3. If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay. The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4. This feeder holds more than enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway. We found that if we fill it about 1/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out. Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement. ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1. The perch is much better than some of their other styles, but is still sort of a pain to keep aligned. It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.  Being a one piece circle does make it easier to align.2.  This unit is WAY too large, at least in our area.  The hummingbirds in our area do not usually allow others to feed at the same time, thus it takes quite a bit of time to go through the amount of nectar that this unit will hold.  If, however, you happen to live in an area where several will share a feeder at the same time, this may work out for you.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should. One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!! When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage. TL;DR:",

That's quite a qualified statement, so it's hard to argue that this is Perky Pet's best glass feeder (as opposed to their other glass feeders, or their other plastic feeders). The glass cylinder gives it a good appearance, and its 30 ounce capacity should supply the needs of all but the most hungry hummingbirds.I didn't have any issues with leaking in the four weeks that I've been using the feeder, as has been mentioned in other reviews. The base comes apart, making cleaning easy, unlike their super-sized 48-ounce feeder that I also tested. The neck of the glass cylinder is a bit narrow, so you will need a bottle brush or some practice with swishing a wettened paper towel or cloth to get the inside surface cleaned. The red plastic cap has a loop for the supplied S-hook, and it can stand inverted on a flat surface so that it can be filled without tipping.This feeder comes with a small packet of nectar concentrate, and I would advise tossing it in the garbage and mix up a fresh batch of nectar by boiling water and mixing four parts water with one part sugar. This is the recipe most recommended by experts, and it skips the unnecessary and possibly harmful red dye. I know that Perky Pet says on the label that it won't hurt the birds, but it's not necessary to have red juice, so why add the dye and take the chance?For a cylinder-style feeder, this is a decent unit. However, I still like the dish-style feeders that are available from Aspects under the name &#34;Hummzinger&#34; here on Amazon. Wild Birds Unlimited sells the same type. These are hands-down the best feeders I've ever used, so while this feeder might be the best glass feeder sold by Perky Pet, it's not the best overall hummingbird feeder in my opinion.Even given that fact, I'm giving this a four-star rating, because it does have some good features and I didn't run into any major issues. I would spend my money on something else, but if this type of feeder appeals to you, I think you will like it. TL;DR:",

The instructions tell you to hand wash with soap and water twice a week.  Being lazy and in order to test it, I ran the whole thing through the dishwasher on the top rack.  The glass was fine.  The perches got a little bendy, I probably will not send that part through again.  Because these things need to be cleaned all the time, and it&#8217;s hard to get into the little crevices in the flowers I wish it was dishwasher safe. However,  een if you have to hand wash, it comes apart easily for cleaning but you will still need a tiny brush to clean out the holes.  I LOVE that you can stand it on end to fill, this is a huge plus, no more trying to hold the feeder in one hand and fill with the other.  The flowers also have a little tube that sticks up on them, this does seem to dissuade the bee&#8217;s, but not stop them altogether.The ant moat is too shallow  to be effective here in New Mexico, after three hours all the water had evaporated.  I hang my feeders from plastic bell shaped hooks (type plastic bell ant guard) anyway because all the water moats I have ever tried dry out too quickly.Within minutes of hanging this feeder  (replacing a Dr. JB&#8217;s feeder) there was a black chinned hummingbird partaking.  My usual standby feeders are the Dr. JB Clean Feeder, because they hold a LOT of nectar ( I have one that holds 80 oz) and they can been thrown in the dishwasher.  However, they are much more expensive than these feeders, more than twice as much.  I had both hanging up for a day and did not notice any difference in which one they chose.  I would post a photo, but it appears that we cannot do that anymore.Here is how I make nectar (that red stuff is not supposed to be good for the hummingbirds and it costs too much).  I use a plastic bottle that juice came in (like cranberry juice) onto which I have sharpied a line which is one quarter of the volume (this makes a sweet solution, you can also do one fifth).  Fill up to that line with sugar.  Add very hot water (not quite boiling) leaving a little air space, the water that comes out of my faucet near my hot water heater is actually hot enough.  Put on the lid and shake.  Faster and easier than boiling up a solution every time.  Store extra in the frig.

It comes in the standard 1 cubic foot bag like other soils which helps it to stack well with the rest of my garden bags.  I followed the directions on the bag making a 3 inch layer of this garden soil and working it into the top 6 inches of my top soil.  The directions are slightly different for raised beds or for individual plants. But basically it ends up being a 50/50 mixed of this garden soil and your top soil.  I like that the nitrogen, phosphate, calcium and sulphate ingredients are coated which allows them to slowly release over time.  I think this may help them not to pollute the ground water and that makes it good for the environment. My flowers have already grown a noticeable 25% or more which has really helped to make my house look great.  Since they are still growing, by the time growing season is over I hope to get twice the growth like the bag says will happen..  I may need to adjust something in my soil preparation or watering.

        "reviewText": "Perlite (any brand) is designed to improve drainage and aeration in soil.  It's white and lightweight - Using it ensures that your soil will drain better as it adds air pockets.  More air pockets = more root growth.There is no exact science of how much perlite to use with your soil - I would suggest for every 2-3 scoops of soil, you add a scoop of perlite.  If you add more perlite than what I suggest, it's not going to hurt anything, you may simply find that you have to water more frequently since your soil mixture will drain really quickly and may dry out faster.As with all Miracle-Gro products, this Perlite provides a small amount of fertilizer (.07 each of Nitrogen - promotes top growth, Phosphate - promotes healthy roots and Potash - promotes abundant fruits and flowers).  I view the Miracle-Gro fertilizer addition as basically a &#34;starter&#34; fertilizer.  It doesn't eliminate your need to fertilize in the future, it merely provides some of the basic nutrients throughout the 1st few watering; you'll then need to research your plant's nutritional needs and fertilize as  recommended.On a side note, I would strongly suggest that if your order this at Amazon, be VERY careful while opening your box.  Mine fit perfectly in the box (with virtually no extra space) and I nearly nicked the bag with a knife while cutting open the box which would have lead to a HUGE mess.  Lastly, this product can often be found for less than $5-6 for an 8 qt bag so it might be worth shopping around.  Happy Gardening! TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I'm a believer in the benefits of using perlite. It helps keep soil from compacting, giving roots the best opportunity to thrive. I grow a lot of flowering annuals that I primarily begin from cuttings. Blooming plants add more to my home than any piece of furniture ever could and I love that family and friends love them as gifts.You can find perlite in a range of prices depending on whether it's organic and/or contains nutrients. For the most part, I use the less expensive, non-enriched stuff, about $25 for a 4 cubic foot bag (about 120 US quarts).At $5 for 8 quarts, the same amount of Miracle-Gro's perlite with nutrients would cost around $75. It pays to figure out which stuff to use when.For example, if I am given cuttings or seedlings that still need to establish roots, I like to use the more expensive, nutrient enriched perlite and Miracle Gro is my go-to brand. When it's time to transplant, I use a high quality soil (FoxFarm FX14000 1-1/2-Cubic Feet FoxFarm Ocean Forest Organic Soilis a personal fav) mixed with the cheaper plain old perlite.When I transplant, I transplant into a new container that is not too much bigger than the old one. When I see roots are ready to emerge from the new pot, I transplate it into the next size up. If the plant is going to eventually end up in an 8 gallon container, for example, I will transplant it 3 or 4 times to get it there. I get that doing multiple transplants isn't for everyone, and maybe I'm fooling myself, but I believe my plants grow bigger and faster doing it this way.The point of this, regarding perlite, is that the more expensive stuff isn't necessary when transplanting so often. The soil contains all the nutrients needed for the amount of time a plant is in each container. It isn't until I move the plant into the container in which it will eventually bloom and live out its life, that I pop for the more expensive perlite.From that point, I alternate feeding the plant plain water or a mixture of nutrients based on stage of growth (FoxFarm FX14006 1-Quart FoxFarm Grow Big Liquid Concentrate 6-4-4for example). My formula mix is heavy with nitrogen at first to grow the plant big and green and then gets switched up when budding starts and again when flowers bloom. All along, the Miracle-Gro provides any necessary \"back up\" nutrients during the water only feedings. Plus roots stay happy in non-compacting soil.I also do not pop for the more expensive perlite when storing bulbs. Water is what releases the nutrients in enriched perlite. Bulbs are stored dry, so I save the bucks when I can.Miracle-Gro's perlite is my brand for the nutrient enriched. It has proven itself to me year after year, and I stick with what's proven successful. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "Perlite is a naturally occurring substance that is commonly used with potted plants to prevent soil compaction. It can also be used improve drainage and promote strong root development. You can also use it to store bulbs and root crops by pouring it around them and not packing or watering.The amount you use should depend on the particular plant. With rarer plants, chances are that you can find a website that gives a soil recipe saying how much to use in proportion to anything else. The bag says that this 8 QT bag will fill two eight inch pots, so that should give an idea how much perlite you will get.Miracle-Gro's brand also contains their plant food. Previously it had total Nitrogen is 0.04%, Available phosphate is 0.01% and Soluble potash is 0.06%. The bag I just got lists 0.07% each for all three. Although I've had very good results with their plant food, I'm not sure if there's a big advantage to having it integrated since you could add it on your own and I would recommend having a supply on hand. Nevertheless, it probably couldn't hurt. I say \"probably\" because there are some rare tropical plants and probably others that survive on very little nutrients and can be damaged by additives. Nevertheless, I have used this (previous formula) with Nepenthes Ventrata without any problems, and that's a species that's more sensitive to soil balance and more likely to be harmed by the wrong additives than most common house plants.For more typical houseplants, there should be no worries. Miracle-Gro is a leader in plant food and their website has a lot of helpful information on how to use their various products. The instructions on the bag give steps for use with root cuttings and for storing bulbs and root crops. They don't go into specifics for general use and there are a lot of guidelines from horticulturalists but they tend to vary. But it boils down to taking some perlite and other potting soil and mixing it together.  In most cases, somewhere between 25% and 50% will be appropriate. There are even some who grow things in 100% perlite, but I have found that 20-25% works well for me with house plants and a higher ratio works well for vegetable plants.Previously, this came in a bag that was easy to reseal, with a \"Ziploc\" style closure. This new one comes in an easy open non-resealable bag. It's not much of a criticism, but that's a step down from what they had before. TL;DR:",

Perlite is a type of volcanic rock, that has been heated up until is expands. (The rock pops open like popcorn.) Adding perlite to your soil, keeps it from getting too compacted, as well as aiding in drainage.  Perlite helps to keep oxygen in the soil, and air, which the roots need to stay healthy. The biggest cause of death for a typical house plant isn't lack of water, but overwatering.  Add in lack of drainage to overly watered plants, and you get root rot--fast. Since perlite wont hold moisture, its also good for storing plant bulbs.  People also use it to start cuttings, tho I don't.  MIRACLE GRO perlite has their famous fertilizer added.  The price for this bag is cheap, compared to the box stores, and since its available as an ADD ON purchase, you don't have to worry about added shipping. This is perfect for city plant lovers, who might not live near a home depot type store, or gardening center. (Or who don't have the time to go get it even if they did.)You can save a LOT of money if you just make your own potting soil.  I buy the CHEAP potting soil, a dollar a bag, that's just loam, pure black. That type of potting soil is so dense, that most plants would just drown in the constantly wet, poor draining loam. So, just add about one part perlite, to 3 parts potting soil.  Adding a little bit of vermiculite can make the soil retain water, without getting too dense.  People who spend a lot of money for cactus and palm soils are crazy.  Make your own with one part loam, (or ground up coconut shells), one part perlite, and one part vermiculite.  Maybe throw in a little bit of sand too, for very water intolerant cacti. That mix will give you a fast draining soil,  without retaining too much water, which would quickly kill cacti.Perlite tends to FLOAT TO THE TOP OF YOUR SOIL. Its so light, that when you add water to your potting mix, it floats up thru the loam and vermiculite.  The ONLY solution to that, is to put a thin later of very small pebbles on top of your soil. If you are talking about bonsai plants, you might want to avoid perlite, and use fine sized lava rocks, or turface (baked clay) to keep your soil from compacting. Because even if you DO place pebbles on top of your Perlite soils, you will still get that stuff floating up thru the dirt. TL;DR:",

Once the seedlings are well-established, then I transplant outside.I used this mix to start some Papaver somniferum (annual poppies), and it worked as well as anything I've tried in the past.The reason there is a special mix for seed-starting (as opposed to regular potting mix) is that the fertilizer should be a little weaker, so it doesn't burn the delicate roots of seedlings.Because I could not find the ingredients on this product page or anywhere else online, I took a photo; you'll find it in the consumer photos. It's mostly sphagnum peat, with some perlite.As another reviewer mentioned, the mix is a little heavy on the peat for my tastes. It's easy enough to add perlite or vermiculate, another moisture-enhancing soil amendment, if you have it. Perlite looks like little white styrofoam balls, but it is actually a very porous volcanic material that resembles pumice.  It helps avoid soil compaction, improves aeration, and retains moisture, but it promotes better drainage than vermiculite.Whether or not you want to add perlite depends on the container and environment in which you are starting the seeds (e.g. the air temperature, humidity, amount of sunlight, etc.) as well as the kind of plants you are growing. Some love having their \"feet wet\"; some don't.Overall, this seems a good medium for starting most seeds. The important thing is not over- or under-watering.Happy sprouting! TL;DR:",

And that's pretty much what this product is: 85-95% peat (my bag is probably on the high end of that range).  There is also a little perlite, a *very small* amount of chemical fertilizers (.03-.03-.03), and wetting agents to make the peat absorb water easier.  For the people who complained about lots of sticks it's probably coming from the peat - if you buy a bag of peat you generally get a lot of naturally occurring debris.Still, it worked pretty well for me.  The fertilizers are light enough to give a small boost to seedlings without burning them.  I think I might have preferred that it have worm castings added, but that's just my preference.  The peat still took a while to absorb water so the wetting agents are pretty light as well, but it was definitely easier and quicker than plain peat.

Worked great, no difference in germination or initial growth I could see.I'm also using it in a mix I made for the seedlings once they got started. At about an inch-and-a-half tall I put the seedlings in larger containers. There's only very light fertilizer in this starter mix, .03 - .03 - .03 NPK, to avoid burning the new roots, so for more fertilizer I used a 50/50 mix of this andMiracle-Gro Moisture Control Potting Mix(.21 - .11 - .16 NPK). The extra water retention is also helpful, since seedlings are very sensitive to drying out. That 50/50 mix is the top couple inches of soil. Below that I putMiracle-Gro Garden Soil for Flower and Vegetable, since we don't plant tomatoes outside here until June, and it will set the roots in something a little more suitable for outdoors.The seedlings are doing great in that mixture, with more than twice as much leaf growth as the seedlings that are in the same size containers with the local nursery medium. (When they go into the ground outside they'll get less nitrogen in the fertilizer. Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)The main ingredient is listed as 85-95% sphagnum peat moss, and my bag appears to be about 95%, with few twigs, and just a bit of perlite.

The germination failures may have been the result of other factors, so I can't confidently attribute them to this mix. I discovered that my heating pad was running a little high for a couple of days. I have remedied that now and my results on the second batch of seedlings will be available in a few days. I will update soon.The problems with gnats or other small insects and damping off that plagued last year's mix according to old reviews on the prior listing did not occur with this bag.This may be a 5-star product, but I won't upgrade my rating until I'm certain that the germination problem came from elsewhere.

        "reviewText": "May 20, 2014 UpdateI see my review of this product has received no positive and one negative opinions so far. It is my experience that people tend to like positive reviews more than negative reviews. But I count on consumer comments here on Amazon and I want to know what's good and perhaps not so good when I buy an item. Not being shy I'll add to my review with a little more detail.We have now used this hose reel daily for over a month. In general this is a decent hose reel but I have one issue with it. It is a little hard to crank.If you are a young strong person this will not be an issue for you. I am 67 years old and I feel as if I'm working out at the gym when I roll the hose up with this Liberty Garden 710. I believe this is due to two design characteristics.1) The reel itself has a little tension. There is a tension adjust screw which I have backed out all the way, and even have tried removing the tension adjust screw altogether. Perhaps other copies of this reel don't have as much tension. It isn't really tight. It's just enough not to be free wheeling.2) The length of the handle bar, which connects the handle to the center of the hose reel, is a bit short which provides less leverage than would be comfortable for my wife and I. The handle doesn't even extend to the outer edge of the reel. There is plenty of room for a longer handle if Liberty wants to make a design change.As a comparison we have a different hose reel in our front yard. That reel (mentioned below) has zero tension on it with the lock off. Also the handle is mounted on the outer edge of the reel (and that unit has a larger reel diameter) so there is quite a bit more leverage. We find that unit easy to use.So if you don't mind the effort required to use this Liberty Garden 710 then you should be pleased with it. However if you're like my wife and I you may find this just a bit too much effort to use on a daily basis. We have 75' of 5/8\" hose on this reel. We pull it out daily to water flowers in our typical 100+ degree low humidity weather. When we roll the hose up we aren't rolling up with the whole 75' being pulled by the reel. We normally only pull out about 50 feet of hose, then, when we're done watering, we double back to the reel with the hose end in our hand. So we are only pulling 25 feet of hose at most.March 22 updateI did install the reel today. I am concerned about it's use for three reasons.1) It is stiff to wind up the hose. That may improve with time.2) Compared to the plastic reel it replaced (that failed) it protrudes much further from the wall which puts more tension on the bracket. I'm afraid it is going to pull out from the wall. If it does it will be my fault for not using more substantial hardware to install it I guess.3) As I said earlier it has no lock to hold the hose in place when it is reeled in. Perhaps the design makes the hose stiff to reel in so it won't turn too freely, presumably then not requiring a lock.It is my wife, the gardener, who will have the final say. I will leave this review at 4 stars so far as these are just my concerns. Actual use may be better than my first impressions.We have an Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041 in the front yard which we are very pleased with. If this Liberty doesn't work out we will buy a second Eley.Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041ORIGINAL REVIEW...We've had a cheap plastic hose reel in our back yard for about a year. It has worked well but sometimes the whole reel pops off, due to a faulty latch design, and sprays water everywhere. When Amazon offered this Liberty 710 free as part of the Amazon Vine program I snatched it up as a replacement for our cheap plastic reel.Upon opening the box I was pleased by two things about the Liberty 710.1) The entire hose reel consists of two main parts, a handle to be installed, Two screws and nuts, and a leader hose. I really appreciate the design which resulted in very view parts to deal with. The shelf part is installed on a wall without having the weight of the hose reel itself attached. Then attaching the reel is accomplished by simply sliding it into slots on the shelf, then using two screws to hold it in place. The instructions, clear with ample drawings, are easy to understand and follow.2) The materials and construction are of good quality. I wasn't expecting the smoothness of the power coat finish. The steel material seems to be heavy enough last a long time, while not being so heavy as to be difficult to handle. The included leader hose seems to be sturdy with brass fittings.One major concern is there is no lock to keep the reel from turning when the hose is stored. Ideally one would approach the reel, unlock the reel, and pull the hose out for use. Then when finished one would turn the handle to roll up the hose, followed by locking the reel. There is no such lock on the Liberty 710. There is a tension screw but that means if you apply sufficient tension to keep the reel from spinning then it would also be resistant to pulling the hose off the reel for use.Another concern is rust if and when the powder coat is scrapped to the metal level. A substantial aluminum design would be my preference. At least a power coat is superior to a spray paint coating. TL;DR:",

If you think of the weight of the product itself (23 pounds) plus the weight of the hose pipe that you will have hanging on it, then that makes for one very heavy item hanging on your wall.

I moved the 704 to the rear hose bibb on my house and mounted this 710 model one to the front. I needed to be able to rotate the hose reel 90 degrees toward the driveway.Let me say that the 704 model has been my favorite hose reel ever. I had gotten so tired of those plastic reels that go on the ground, then I went thru a plastic reel on the wall. These aluminum reels have been great! I used some 3&#34; deep masonry anchors to mount it to the brick foundation on my home. Installation took about 20 minutes, but it is rock solid. You do want to make sure that it is well secured and leveled especially if you are going to use 125 feet of hose. If you will be mounting it to siding you will want to make sure to mount it wall studs. The mounting holes are spaced 16&#34; apart to land on standard stud spacings. At a minimum I would make sure the right side which is where the crank handle is located, is on a stud.I have a 125 foot hose and was a little concerned that it would not fit on this new reel. The 704 model has a reel that is about 4 inches wider that this 710 model. However this 710 model is deeper and did just hold all 125 feet. I would recommend that you use a lesser length like 100 ft or 75 ft if you can as it is much easier to reel in.The fit and finish on these are great. I've had my other reel for well over a couple of years and it has not rusted at all. The finish has faded slightly but not too terribly. I may take the hose out and mask and spray paint a new finish on it next year if needed.To rotate the reel use need to pull up on the large knob at the center of the front edge of the top of the platform. This will raise a downward facing locking pin that will disengage from a hole slot in the reel mounting plate and allow you to pick another hole. There are 4 holes which allow you to choose 90 degree increments. I guess in a pinch you could add your own custom angles by drilling extra holes in the plate. I may try this.Overall I don't think you will be disappointed is either Liberty Garden Hose Reels as they are well made and designed. Finally, a long lasting hose reel!5 stars easy! TL;DR:",

I like that it hangs on the wall rather than sitting on the ground because it is less in the way (I don't have a deck to worry about).  And the rotating feature will let me move my hose around to different parts of my yard so much more easily.The back brackets are just over 10 inches long so they fit perfectly and lie flat on my 1950s cedar shakes.  If you have smaller siding, you might have more trouble getting it to sit right on the siding.  (The installation instructions contemplate a flat wall.) The reel pieces go on after you fasten the bracket piece so you don't have to hold the whole thing while you fasten it to the wall.Speaking of fastening, this product does not come with the screws necessary to mount it on your wall.  So it would be a good idea to go out and get the screws while you wait for this to arrive.  The manufacturer recommends (4) 7 or 8 mm lag screws with washers (5/16\" x 2 1/2\") for a flat wood frame wall.  For a brick masonry wall they suggest (4) 7 or 8 mm x 60 mm masonry wall anchors, (4) anchor sleeves, (4) washers, (4) lock washers, and (4) nuts.I am slightly concerned about how this metal hose reel will hold up in Minnesota weather.  However, the manufacturer suggests the hose reel part be taken off and stored indoors or sealed in a plastic container over the winter.  That just leaves the bracket to worry about. TL;DR:",

My house is built from adobe and I cannot anchor things like this to it without pulling it apart. Our barn has studs that are 18 inches and didn't fit. Finally what we did was take a 2x12 and cut it into a rectangle, mount the roller on it and then mount the rectangle of wood on our barn. I don't think you could mount this on cinder block or any of the thinner wooden fencing. This can be a problem as you obviously want it close to a spigot.The unit is VERY heavy. This is both good and bad. Good in that it is not a piece of junk, bad in that you need some serious support to hold it while you yank a hose out of it.I like the tray, great for an extra nozzle or hose splitter.We put a maxflow hose that is only 50 feet so lots of spare room on the winding wheel.Kind of a bummer that there is no auto retraction, but-- hey, it is very attractive and much nicer than the two plastic units I have.

There isn't much assembly and attaching it is relatively straight-forward, though we required additional purchase bolts and a masonry drill as we were affixing it to brick. Once on, it feels sturdy and the shelf is super handy for storing small accessories, such as a small watering can and spray attachment. It held our heavy-duty 100-foot hose with room to spare and the wind is easy to reel back in.As others have noted, there is no reel lock, so the hose tends to droop a bit, but not more than 2-3' feet and can be mitigated with a tuck of the end into the rest of the hose. (Though even that occasionally falls out.) All in all, while not ideal, this isn't a major gripe for me.Overall, this is well-made item that does exactly what it says it will and looks good doing it.

        "reviewText": "This is my favorite of the Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeders that I own. This is my second favorite feeder afterSchrodt Designs Model HBL-B Cobalt Hummingbird Feederto which this is very similar. Let me first describe this feeder and then give you a quick compare and contrast .The nectar holder is clear glass cylinder. Build seems good; there is no description of safety glass so I assume it would shatter if broken. Both ends screw off for easy filling and cleaning of the glass cylinder. Just place the flat end down, fill with a solution of 1 part Baker's Sugar Ultrafine Pure Cane Sugar (found at your supermarket) to 3-4 parts tap water. Screw on the hummingbird feeder basin while the glass cylinder is still upside down. Then screw on the top of the feeder keeping the feeder upside down. Turn the feeder over to release the sugar water into the basin. And hang. Simple. If you spill some sugar water in the process, a light rinse before hanging will help prevent attracting ants and other critters.The basin is plastic surrounded by a metal wire for the hummingbirds to perch while taking a more relaxing drink. We live in the hot desert. I like that the basin is plastic: easier to clean, DOES NOT HEAT the water and is protected from the sun by a sturdy metal base cover with bright red \"flower\" feeding ports. I'm sorry that the perch metal wire around the basin is metal. I've noticed from other models of our Perky-Pet feeders and this too that the hummers don't like holding on to a metal perch in the heat of the sun. But they will sit early in the morning and in the late dusk hour.I like the large reinforced metal wire loop at the top of the feeder--easy to hang and it's not going to break even in brisk weather.The copper color is painted on. It seems like a nice paint and ours has a few spots missing and smudged but the hummers will never notice nor will I unless the feeder is in shade and I'm 8 inches away scrutinizing. It's fine.Comparisons to the Schrodt Design Schrodt Designs Model HBL-B Cobalt Hummingbird FeederVery Similar -- I prefer Schrodt's colored curved glass. It's much lovelier and elegant and probably keeps the 7 oz of sugar water they hold from heating up in the sun. You get bacteria growth from sunlight on sugar water. Whenever you notice the water getting cloudy, something floating in the water or the birds not feeding like they use to, you probably have bacteria growth and need to clean your feeder well. In these instances I will clean them with bleach water and rinse 3 times. One also should find an alternate location more shaded to move the feeder. This may be easier for you but it's kindof hard out here in the land of the sun. The nice design with this Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder is that the little hat provides some sun protection--maybe. The Schrodt feeders are copper and redwood. After 6 years of constant use they do not leak when hanging and I am careful with a quick rinse if I spill any when I turn it upside down. They are pieces of Art and at just over $36 whereas this is half the price. Good Value, Perky-Pets! The Schrodt design is harder to clean but again in 6 years, I've probably had bacteria growth floating in water in the Schrodt design, maybe 4 times over 3 feeders in nearly full sun.This is our 8th feeder. We have lots of hummingbirds and we plant to attact them. This feeder is a winner. TL;DR:",

It was a glass bottle version with wood ends and a plastic insert. Over the years, we tried other feeders but never found another that performed as well. We moved a few years ago and have not bothered to set up a feeder in our new place.This feeder is well constructed and attractive. It is glass with metal ends surrounding plastic threaded caps. It is easy to fill and clean. The old feeder required a long bottlebrush to clean, and even then it was difficult to keep the very top clean. This accommodates a larger brush and is easier to keep clean. It also holds a reasonable amount of liquid. Some people may think larger capacity is better, but it is preferable to refill and clean the feeder more often. In addition, hummingbirds are territorial, and it is unlikely that more than one will feed at a time.The nectar is easy to use: just add 8 ounces of water and mix. No boiling is required and the solution dissolved quickly. I will go back to my old water and sugar solution but I enjoyed trying the included sample packet. TL;DR:",

The 12 ounce capacity makes refilling less of a hassle.My concerns:1. While the 12 ounce capacity is nice, I am worried that mold will be an issue if the humming birds are not feeding frequently. (I only filled the unit a quarter full and am going to monitor how quickly the nectar goes before increasing the amount I put in - we are early days for humming birds right now.)2. Rust - these sorts of feeders are always prone to rusting, time will tell if this is an issue with this particular unit.3. Color - I really do not like overly garish feeders but we all know that humming birds are attracted to flash, this unit is on the elegant side and time will tell if it has enough brightness to attract the birds.Recommended with above reservations.*The totally unintentional rhyming ends here - you are welcome.

        "reviewText": "This is the third Perky Pet hummingbird feeder I've tested, and it's my favorite. It's the most attractive, with a glass cylinder and a copper finish on the metal cap and the plastic base surround, with metal flowers surrounding the ports that are protected by what the company identifies as bee guards. We haven't hit the time of year when bees are a problem around our hummingbird feeders, so I can't attest to their effectiveness.The glass cylinder is quite narrow, so it will be difficult to clean without a bottle brush. I also suggest getting a small brush to clean the ports, as they are deep enough that you really want to make sure that they get clean. The base comes apart, so it's easy to clean, but the metal flowers will slow you down a little. It's worth it, though, since they add to the attractiveness of the feeder. I didn't have any trouble with leaking, which was reported in some other reviews.The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder the best as well. Of the three feeders (all cylinder-style), they have been most attracted to this feeder. They do seem to have some problem perching and eating at the same time. It's possible that the bee guards are impeding their ability to get to the juice while sitting on the perches, as they usually hover while feeding.As with the 30-ounce feeder, this feeder came with a packet of nectar concentrate. I recommend tossing it in the garbage, and make a fresh batch of nectar by using four parts boiled water to one part sugar. The packet contains red dye, which the company states is harmless to the birds, but it's not necessary to attract them, so why take the chance?This is a very attractive feeder and would make a great gift. While they are not nearly as attractive, I still prefer the dish-style feeders, like the Aspects Hummzinger feeders that are available here, and the similar Wild Birds Unlimited-branded feeders, but this is pretty good as well.

The unit has a sufficinetly large opening, so it can be filled relatively easily.If you need a larger feeder like this, it may be a good choice.  However, be mindful of the fact that the sugar water must be changed every five (5) days or so.  Accordingly, you may find that sixteen (16) ounces of fluid is more than you need and you may end up pouring most of it out at the end of the week.  An eight (8) ounce unit may be a better choice.This model lacks an included hook for hanging.The bottle of this model is not open at each end, it is more difficult to clean than a model with a larger opening at the top.  Perky Pet makes at least one other model which opens on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end. That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.I have four different models, but far prefer the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder which has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.

The birds must know quality better than most.  This one is glass and frankly, I am a glass snob with vigor.  Glass cleans better and lasts longer while apparently not leaving any residue from cleaning.Let's start at the moat top.  Instead of having to arrange a separate contraption such as I have previously and will do again this year, this feeder has an area in the top that permits visitors from below to stop by and drown.  I've always wondered if the dead creatures would be eaten by the hummers, but I have no evidence of that taking place.  But I always look.  The red top unscrews to permit full cleaning of the glass container.  I used a metal rod for holding plants to stakes to configure a tie down for the top's hanger.  It works well for me and I can control the size.The pinch waist permits more steady control of the feeder when holding or going from one location to another, but the real sensible addition to this feeder is the hummers' goodies (food) goes into the bottom instead of the top.  Picture turning the feeder upside down with the top engaged onto the glass feeder and pouring the food into the feeder while it is sitting on the sink.  When you have filled the feeder to the level you want, screw the bottom of the unit while still upside down and carry it to the feeder.  At that point turn the unit over and place it on the Shepard's hook or whatever you use to hold the feeder.  The incidence of spillage will reduce immediately.  (As was said by someone who could spill a steel rod.)After screwing the roosts onto the main unit and assuring their proper place in front of the little feeder holes the rest is as simple.  The bottom consists of two pieces which helps with keeping the entire unit clean and the hummers appreciate it.Right now, this unit has jumped from last to first in one week's use.  Another Perky-Pet occupies that #1 position and in a few days it will be joined by another family member.  Those little critters provide so much joy to us and some of our neighbors. TL;DR:",

The ant water trap at the top works just the way it should and we just refill that each morning when we put it out.I'm surprised by people who complain that they have to fill the water each day - aren't you refilling your feeder each day? Or bringing it in at night? If we don't bring ours in, raccoons climb right up and drink from it :).

There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds.  The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.3.  If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay.  The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4.  This feeder holds just enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway.  We found that if we fill it about 2/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out.  Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement.  ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1.  The perch is sort of a pain to keep aligned.  It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should.  One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!!  When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I have a few hummingbird feeders. The Perky-Pet Pinch Waist Glass feeder seems like a good one. The main problems with hummingbird feeders is they can leak, they fill up with ants and the wasps take over and keep the birds away. This feeder after being up for a week does not leak. They have addressed the other issues, but it will be awhile in Wisconsin before these other issues are tested. The area where the bird gets the juice has a raised end point to keep the wasps from getting the juice. The top of the feeder has a reservoir which can be filled with water to keep the ants from crossing over to the feeder from the hanger. I have not yet been able to test these, but they do seem like good ideas.One problem that I can foresee is that the water will evaporate quickly and will require attention. The container for the provided nectar fills the feeder about half way. Generally we just use sugar and water which is boiled to purify. This takes time and a  premix would be nice, though the one that comes with the unit does have food coloring in it which I see as unnecessary. The perches on the feeder are very flimsy but then...hummingbirds don't weigh much.  Overall you likely cannot go wrong with this feeder. If the pest &#34;fixes&#34; don't work, you have a good feeder which will be just like all other feeders anyway. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "UPDATE 6/22/14:  I have gotten so many compliments on this set.  Everyone that sees it loves it.  Also the chair cushions are the most comfortable, especially for long time sitting.  One thing, which is why the 4 stars remain.  There are no ties on the back cushions and there really should be.  The bottom cushions have them, why not the back cushions??  I have to go out and pick up the cushions constantly as they blow around the back yard at the mildest wind.  It is windy here in So. AZ and I have had to sew on ties myself.  This would have made the set perfect if they came with the ties already on.  Still love it, however.It took about an hour to unpack and assemble.  It came in three large boxes, shrink wrapped and on a pallet.  The longest part was the unpacking.  It was well protected, with lots of heavy paper wrapped around every part of the chairs.  The chairs, themselves, come in two pieces and have four bolts to put in which is very easy if you have a helper but not impossible for one person to do.  The fire pit itself came completely assembled.  However, to get it through the house to the back yard I did have to take the top off.  That was easy since it had only four screws holding that on.Everything is well made and the chairs are very comfortable.  The seat bottom is made in a way so that it is not supposed to sag over time.  The reason for the 4 stars is the color of the upholstery.  It tends to be on the yellowish side of brown and everything in my yard leans toward reddish brown. The product picture even has a slight reddish tone to it.  Wish there was a choice of upholstery colors.  But I must say I am very pleased with the quality.This set will be outside 24/7 in Southern Arizona so the cloth and the metal finish will really get a tough test.  I would like to download my pictures but did not see anyway to do it for this product. TL;DR:",

Everything we received was in excellent condition and there was no damage to any of the furniture. I was definitely worried about putting this set together, but it went together incredibly smoothly and I will even say easily. I have to admit, I did not put it together myself, I am not able to physically right now, but my daughter and two of her friends (all three 19 years old) had the whole set together and everything up and running in about an hour, maybe a little longer. I watched them put the chairs together and they were really just two pieces and the bolts. Once the figured out the first chair, the next 3 were easy. Same for the table/fire pit, once they got the gist of the instructions it went together pretty easy. I still can't believe it. I was pretty proud of them.I thought it would be in parts in my yard for a week at least. The only thing one of them did say, is it would have been nice to have some written instructions rather than just the drawn kind, but they did figure those out, it just took a little longer.Now that it's together, we just love it. We love the look of the set and everything is just so well made. The chairs rock very nicely, but do not tip back too far and the cushions are sturdy, thick and really just awesome to sit on. I've never had really well made patio cushions before, so I am appreciating the ones with this set. One little thing I will mention that isn't a big deal, but more of a personal preference is that I wish the the backs on the chairs were just a little higher. That is a personal thing though and I am the only one who mentioned it in using the set, maybe because I am taller, I just prefer my chair backs a little higher.It's been pretty cool in the evenings so we have been getting quite a bit of use out of the fire pit and table. It is just perfect for a cool evening. Easy to set up and use, we have enjoyed it many nights already.I went back and forth between a 4 and 5 review for this set. Recently the set here on Amazon was priced at $1,299 and at the price it is definitely a 5 star patio set. Now though, it is priced at $1,799 and even though it is a very nice quality set, I can't quite give it 5 stars, the price now being the reason for the 4 star review today 6/17/14. The patio set itself is very nice though, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending to anyone, just maybe shop around a little bit first. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "There are a few aspects of this well-made set that should get some attention in a review, especially for a high-ticket item like this one.ARRIVAL AND ASSEMBLY - at least as I received it, it comes in three big boxes on a pallet. As other reviews noted, it will take about about an hour to break everything down, take all the packing paper off, get it all out of the boxes THEN you can start to actually construct it.Good news - while the paper is all taped around the chair's metal frames, it is easily ripped masking tape. So it wasn't difficult to get the packing paper off, just time consuming. And that's a good thing! The set should arrive without any dings or damage.The fire pit comes assembled. It is a TWO person job to move it, and it it's in top box. So expect to need two people to do all this.The chairs are easy to assemble with two people AND a socket wrench set. I tried to use the included wrench, but that would have taken forever! But using a socket wrench took maybe two minutes a chair - very easy. Again - two person job. I wouldn't even try to do it myself. The chairs are not light, and to line up and then screw in the bolts is not worth the hassle of doing it yourself. And to repeat - use a socket wrench.You are going to be left with an enormous amount of packing material - again, not a bad thing. Just make some space before it all arrives so you don't huge cardboard boxes getting in your way after the fact.QUALITY - this is really the most important thing anyway, and on this score, this set seems worth the money and very well-made.The chairs are metal with welded slats to enable the rocking. While the metal is light, it's still heavy-duty enough to hold up against the sun and the rain (I hope, anyway). The rocking motion is nice and i think a neat switch from a standard unmoving chair.The cushions are thick fabric - and you're going to pay at least $50 for a similar cushion anywhere I've seen. Maybe more, since this is a two cushion set. Again, the fabric seems good quality and should hold up.If you paid $225 for the chair/cushion, you'd be looking at $900 for the set and I don't think that's unreasonable. Expensive, but not unreasonable or unexpected. The cushions would probably be included.The fire pit is solid, and while I don't love the design on the sides, it's okay and you won't notice it that much. The pit itself is not that high and a few chairs around the edge will fill it in quite nicely. It certainly would cost $400 by itself - probably more. And with the chairs, that puts this at a fair price of $1300, which is what it's currently listed at.As for the fire pit performance, I haven't used it yet, but I'll update that part of it later. I wanted to do all this now while it was fresh in my head! It's not like you'll be cooking on the flame, anyway. It's mostly for the ambience.SIZE - I have a 20x11 deck, and that is the minimum amount of space you need - assuming you already have other deck furniture. I already had a table, a few chairs and a chaisse lounge. Obviously, these chairs replaced a few others - but even then, the space got filled quick. Ideally, you'd have a 20x16 space, and I think that would be perfect.The chairs rock, so you can't push them up against a fence or railing - not a negative, just be aware. They take up space but they are big and comfortable. They are deep cushioned, so you'll end up sitting back from the table a little bit.The fire pit measures 38x38, but again - it's more than that. You need space for the chairs to have space, and it's going to take up a lot, quick. So if you ALREADY have a table/umbrella like most decks do, be aware of all that.None of this is a bad thing, and most buyers probably have a lot more space than me and it won't even be an issue.To sum up - good quality that feels high-end and well-made. They're charging high-end price and they are delivering a product that seems to deserve it. The cushions and the rocking chair are fun. The fire pit ledge gives a good space to put drinks, but I don't think I'd try to use it as an eating surface.It doesn't come with a cover, and I would get one. I don't like the idea of rainwater getting underneath the rocks...although since it doesn't have a base, the water won't collect in anything. Still, I would get a cover.At $1300, it's pricey, but I think you'll get what you're paying for - I like these chairs, and the pit is a neat addition to the deck ambiance. I will update this review as I see the quality prove itself over the sun and rain of the summer months. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I'm a little stumped on how to rate this set.  From a construction standpoint both the chairs and the fire pit are top notch, but while I love the chairs I honestly don't care for the \"look\" of the fire pit.  It is just too Gothic/medieval looking for my tastes.Chairs:* The chairs are sturdy and well-constructed (will probably last for decades).  Everything seems to be made of the highest quality materials.*  The frames are made of heavy-gauge aluminum-alloy, and finished in an attractive shade of oiled-rubbed bronze.  There are subtle hints of gold along the edges of the metal bars and the circular details on the sides of the chair.*  The welded joints are flat and smooth with no rough seams to snag your clothing or prick your fingers.*  The chairs are described as rockers, but the motion is very subtle.  The \"rocking\" is a smooth back and forth motion and with very little of an up and down element, more like a glider and less like the see-saw motion of a traditional rocking chair.* The cushions are plump and the stuffing is soft.  The fabric is thick enough to withstand years of exposure to the elements.  But I also found the think fabric a little stiff and coarse (more on the burlap end than the polished cotton end).  The color of the fabric is an earthy kind of yellowish brown.  It is a little dull and boring at first glance, but I added some bright floral throw pillows to brighten it up.  The bottom cushions have extra strong Velcro straps to secure them to the chair, but the back cushion is not attached to the chair.  Having the back cushion loose lets you adjust the plump cushion for the most comfortable position.  The loose, back cushion also allows a tall person to remove it completely.  I have some tall (6'+) people in the family, and they have mentioned that the fat pillows force them to sit too far forward in the chair.  Removing the back cushion makes them feel less like they are perched on the edge of the seat.  The metal back of the chair is also nicely curved so sitting without the back cushion is completely comfortable.Fire Pit:I'm sorry but I just don't like the way the fire pit looks.  It is big and bulky and looks like something you would find in a medieval castle, or at Stonehenge, or at Machu Picchu.  Did I mention that it was Big?  And Huge?  And Heavy?  This is not something that you can easily put away during the summer.  I also don't care for the molded decorations on the sides of the pit.  The fiberglass is painted black and gold to match the chairs, but the dark colors just make the pit look like a massive boulder.  My first impression when I unboxed the pit was that someone had sent me King Arthur's Stone.But on a positive note the fire pit is easy to operate.  Hooking up the propane is a snap, and the lava rocks are so much nicer than the popping wood of my old fire pit.  It is also great that you can adjust the flame to suite the mood or the outside temperature.  But I do wish the pit came with a cover to conceal and protect the element/fire ring when not in use.  The fire pit is too big to store in the shed during the summer so I'm afraid the pit will have to weather the heat, humidity and rain of summer.  I expect bugs and mildew will invade the dark recesses of the pit in no time flat.So how many stars?  I'll give it 4.  I love the chairs and most of my objections to the fire pit are just a matter of personal taste. TL;DR:",

After I got this hose untangled which took a while (it doesn't compress as small as the Pocket Hose) I connected it eagerly.  I was impressed by the brass fittings and sturdy appearance of the hose, but it's maybe too much of a good thing.  First off it wouldn't expand smoothly.  The crinkled fabric outer skin bunched up in various areas restricting the water flow to other parts.  I couldn't manually smooth out the troubled areas, but figured since I didn't really need all 50' on my deck, that wasn't a deal breaker.In order to get the hose to expand to semi-full size, its on/off 'switch' must be in the off position so the water pressure builds up and forces the expansion.  When expanded in that manner, the hose is quite hard and was not easy for me to maneuver.  It is lighter weight than a rubber hose, but not very flexible. Once to the edge of my deck, I opened the pressure switch all the way and got the equivalent of the jet setting on a nozzle attachment.  The water stream projected a long way, but wouldn't be suitable for watering plants.  It had the force of my small pressure washer.  Still, I thought that with a nozzle I might be able to regulate the water flow to my liking.  I never did get around to adding a nozzle though because with the pressure switch open the hose started to contract back to a smaller size and I had to work to keep it from pulling me back to the hookup.  I had to use more and more strength to keep it where I wanted it.  It was not a pleasant experience.I'd had enough with only the one sample use and went to turn off the water and try the Pocket Hose for comparison.  I again turned off the pressure switch on the hose as I returned to the spigot, but when I turned it back on to drain the water after turning the water off at the spigot, the hose went crazy like a striking snake and danced out of my hand spraying me all over.  Too bad someone wasn't taking a video, it would win America's Funniest.The Pocket Hose is a worm compared to this python.  Of course it's only 1/2\" where this is 3/4\", but it's far better behaved and that's the hose I'll be using until the plastic fittings give out.  Still I gave this hose two stars even as I sit here dripping wet because for some folks, particularly stronger people than I, the pressure and power of this hose will be a benefit and the fittings may last longer than the wimpy ones on the Pocket Hose.

I also like the metal fittings which hopefully will hold up much better than the plastic fittings that tend to come with a lot of hoses these days.  No issues connecting to outside faucets or connecting various attachments.However, if you need something with a lot of power you'll need a wider hose circumference than this.  My husband used it to clean off the deck and it didn't have as much pressure as our regular hose.  It did work a better when he took off the spray attachment - enough so that he didn't bother to drag out the regular hose. TL;DR:",

I asked him what he thinks now, and he said, \"Oh, my god, I love it!  You just have to get used to how you have to use it.  We should have gotten one of these years ago.\"  And despite our initial impressions, this is now his go-to hose when he's using a sprinkler.  He's also really happy that you can adjust the spray to high pressure without needing an attachment (a feature he didn't think he needed at first but now regularly uses).Here's my original review:This hose will NOT replace all hose needs.  If you need a very lightweight hose for, say, watering planters near the faucet, this will work.  But that's about all it's good for.Pros:*It's shockingly light.*It does retract (sort of).Cons:*You will not get anywhere near a 50-foot reach with this thing.  30 is more like it.*The flow is VERY low.*It's impractical to use with any attachment (sprinkler, for example) because the end of the hose (and the attachment) whips around when you turn off the water.*Speaking of whipping around, make sure there are no kids, pets, plants, or anything breakable in the way of this hose or near the end when you turn off the faucet.  The hose is gonna whip 'em.*The hose doesn't seem very sturdy or durable.However, if you really want and/or need a lightweight hose, as long as you know what you are in for with this type of product, this is probably among the better ones.  But for our yard, it was really little more than a novelty.  I'll stick with lugging myGilmouraround. TL;DR:",

You must allow it to fill slowly. It is fun to watch but takes well a minute.-According to instructions, you mustn't store it in direct sunlight.

The Rumfort Gardener Tuff-Guard Expanding Hose is a real blessing, because it's lighter, more compact, more attractive, and makes the chore so much easier.  Simply attach the female coupling to the water source, turn the on-off valve to off, turn the water at the source by slowly increasing the pressure, and the hose will automatically expand to approximately 50 feet.  The solid brass valve can be adjusted to get a powerful spray, but is designed to attach a sprinkler too.  Simply follow the basic instructions, attach the sprinkler while the valve is off, face the sprinkler away from you, place it where needed, and turn the valve on.  However, it is not recommended that you use a high pressure nozzle or pressure washer, so this may be an issue for some people - hence the 4-stars.  When finished watering, allow the water in the hose to flow out by leaving the valve on, and the hose will shrink to a smaller size.Warnings found in the instructions are, that it is not intended for drinking water; do not stretch or expand when empty; do not run hot water through it; do not leave hose under pressure with water on if not in use; and keep hose indoors and dry during winter.

Oh, to have a hose on hand!!!!But, as anyone knows who owns a hose, they are bulky, heavy and if you are transporting them in your vehicle, they take up a VAST amount of room! So, it was with great interest that I ordered THIS expandable hose, having seen them advertised on TV for years and on the snarkier side, seeing them lying in dirty coils in the trash cans in our alleys.When I received the box, I was immediately impressed with the uber-light weight of \"fifty feet of hose\" and the teeny-tiny box it came packaged inside of. I was also impressed with the very heavy duty brass couplings, since the tossed away hoses I've seen ALL had cheap plastic couplings.I read the instructions, had the gate valve OFF, slowly allowed the water to expand the hose, and then I waited an additional 10 minutes for the hose to reach maximum length. However, I did have to manually \"extend\" the hose by starting at the faucet and stretching out the wrinkles from the covering, so that it was as close to 50 feet as advertised.How does it work? GREAT, if you have NO HOSE! Also, GREAT if you don't need a standard hose's far more rapid and pressurized volume of water. You will NOT be able to use the Jet setting on your nozzle to power wash your deck or sidewalk. You will NOT be able to fill a 5 gallon bucket very fast. But, for watering some hanging baskets or shrubs or allowing for more time to fill up a pond or bucket, this hose sure beats having NO HOSE!One note of caution: with the wrinkles that are ALWAYS present on the surface of this hose, it catches/snags on the slightest of surfaces in your garden, which may exacerbate the demise of it's lifespan. A normal smooth-surface garden hose glides over flagstone, mulch and gravel; the textured surface of this hose snags on everything! So, when I was using it, I literally had to start at the nozzle and \"walk the hose\" over the entire surface of the job site so I could avoid snagging it and ripping it. And when I drained and coiled it up, I had to end up washing the entire hose off because it picked up all the sand we laid on the patio, making for one messy hose.This may read as a negative review but it's NOT! I'd \"give a kidney\" to have a hose in a pinch at a job site and am exceedingly pleased that I can drain and coil this hose up into a shoe-box sized container, to have \"In Case of Emergency\".

        "reviewText": "So I have the As Seen On TV version and its cheaply made including the easy to crack plastic fittings even though they claim its now made 3X stronger. The Rumford came in a much bigger box as it doesn't coil up as small as the ASOTV version. But, that's a good thing because the Rumford is made of better higher quality materials. First off the hose rubber feels thicker and the outer fabric is much better. The fittings are brass and it also has an on off valve on it so if you didn't want to hook up one of those sprayer nozzles you don't have to.The ASOTV version doesn't tell you that you need to slowly turn on the faucet because the pressure will burst it. It also doesn't tell you how much pressure it is rated for whereas the Rumford is rated for 250psi. From my research, i do not think either version likes to stay out in the weather so I recommend that after use, you put it in a shed, garage or some kind go mini storage shed out of the sun as the UV may damage it and lessen the life of the hose.The hose itself is very thin and you won't get the same pressure as a normal garden hose because its just to thin. Its more for watering plants and the quick use especially in off seasons where your main hose is away for the winter. I've used this to wash the car real fast to get the salt off it from the roads since my regular hose was frozen. Its easy to quick connect, use and then disconnect and put in the garage out of the cold and harsh weather.One thing I immediately noticed is that it smells. I guess its the rubber or something but its stinky. Don't drink from it or let the kids do that either, not that you should anyway because of the bacteria...i watch Dr. Oz too much i think..lolFor now its convenient and there's no winding up the hose in one of those crank storage boxes which is the main reason for getting this hose. I seem to curse at the regular hose every time i use it because its difficult to unwind and then rewind because it gets bent and tangled up. This hose surely keeps that from happening.Can't say how long this version of the expanding hose will last but we shall see. I gave it 4 stars because its just not thick enough for all purposes I need. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This is the first compact, expandable hose I've ever used and I am quite impressed with its portability. I've bought a number of hoses in my life - and something always happens to the hose to make it worthless. The cheap hoses give you a lot of length for very low cost - but they kink within minutes of unwrapping them from their manufactured packaging. I've spent big money on the high-end hoses that don't kink - but they are so heavy and cumbersome. You have to roll them up - eventually you just leave them out and something happens to bend/crimp the metal end to make them unusable.There are drawbacks to any scenario - including this compact hose. You have to fill it completely (which is kinda fun the first time around) to build up the pressure to expand it before you can start to use it. This isn't the kinda hose you just let trickle while taking a sip at the other end - it's not a pressure washer per se, but you have to have the nozzle on the business end for it to work. When you're done using the hose, you have to let the water get out of it so it can retract to storage size.We live out in the country, so a pile of hose is an invitation for snakes, spiders and other unseemly creatures to huddle. I like that this is so light weight and portable, that I can quickly remove it and put it in storage when it's not in use and its long enough that I can use it just about anywhere in our yard.The fabric will pick up dirt, pollen, etc. - but there are trade offs for any gizmo you get. The pluses outweigh the negatives in my book. TL;DR:",

Here are my thoughts.Good:-The fittings are beefy brass and feel solid and are smooth to operate.-The shutoff valve has what I believe to be a stainless steel ball, not just plastic.-The collars of the fittings travel down the hose a bit, to help ease the concern of damage to the connection points.-The hose is incredibly light.-The webbing feels durable.-It expands to 50 feet and shrinks down to about 20 feet.-Easy to store.-Nice strong stream.Not so good:-During use, you have to let the hose fill up with the shutoff valve turned off. Once the hose is filled and expanded, then you can open the valve and use the hose. Maybe my water pressure is not up to this hose's requirements, but the hose shrinks down to about 34 feet during use. It sprays out for a while until it shrinks down, then it turns into a full pressure stream. If I just turn the water on without giving it time to fill up and expand, the full pressure stream comes out and it slowly expands a little, but not to the full length.-While the hose is not fully expanded, it is stretchy. This concerns me as the fittings receive a lot of strain during this. I wish they had made the fittings travel even further up the hose with a long point of contact. I'd feel a lot more confident.-If I have a 50 foot hose, I expect it to be a 50 foot hose - not 50 foot for a few seconds and then 34 foot.It has promise, but maybe this style hose just isn't for me. Maybe my water pressure is not strong enough to maintain the full length during use. My expectation was for the hose to maintain the 50 foot length until I was done and ready to put it up. I'll let it fill up and expand, walk out to my tree to water it, and once I turn the water on, I have to start walking backward as the hose shrinks on me. Convenience lost! TL;DR:",

Not a huge deal since most of the time, you're not moving it, but it *is* heavy and despite the big wheels, it's not easy to pull around.Assembly was somewhat frustrating, though not technically difficult. The instructions were clear - very clear - but snapping together some of the pieces was very difficult. I specifically struggled with the wheels; the wheel trim, shown in the image here as yellow - mine were silver, were supposed to be removed before putting on the wheels. Then, you put the wheel trim back in after the wheels were on and snap/push it into place. It was very hard to do that. I also struggled with transport handle; I really had to struggle to get the piece lined up right to get the screws in. I essentially had to bend/shove it into place so I could get it attached.Total time to get this put together: less than 30 mins.The AC cord is plenty long, as is the cord for the trigger gun. The cord for the gun had to be un-looped several times; I can only hope this loosens up in time - it's pretty stiff.When I used this for the first time, there was a weird motor noise that kept happening when I was spraying. It was like the motor was struggling, or tripping - every few seconds. I reset the power and did not experience this problem again. However, there were three other occasions where the power was tripped and I had to reset it. I have no idea why, or if this is normal behavior for this particular unit.There are two wands that come with the unit:1) Vario Power Spray wand2) Dirtblaster (rotary spray wand)The unit is plenty powerful, so no issues there. I tried both wands and found that the Dirtblaster wand was easier to use. I power washed the siding on my house and some pavement. I also accidentally swiped this over my cedar fence and deck - DO NOT DO THAT - it will shred soft wood like that.However, the Dirtblaster wand is supposed to spray in a circular motion - and it did, for a while - but it didn't do that all the time. Sometimes it would spray in a circular motion, sometimes just a straight stream of water. It cleaned just fine either way, but I think something was off about that. In reading the instructions, it says that the Dirtblaster wand is NOT to be used for siding, so don't be like me - read the manual first!Overall, a great power washer!PROS: Very powerful and capable, front lip for holding wand cord, detergent tank, two wands for cleaning of most surfaces, easy to wind AC cord around back.CONS: Heavy. Wand cord is super stiff. Not easy to pull this unit around. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I have a very minimal need for pressure washing, pretty much limited to doing the front stairs and sidewalk and maybe the back deck once a year or so. For that reason, I prefer the smaller, easier to handle electric type. I didn't have any complaints about myAR Blue Clean AR383 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 14 Amp Electric Pressure Washer with Hose Reel, but I was glad to give this Karcher with similar specs and profile a try.Really the only thing I didn't like was the amount of assembly required and the crappy instructions for putting it together. I don't know when it became fashionable for companies to give all their assembly and operation instructions with pictures only, but I'd wish they'd stop and just tell us what to do. Fortunately, assembling the pieces of this pressure washer was not that bad, as there are only a few ways things can go together in the first place. All in all assembly took only around thirty minutes and I didn't use nearly as many bad words as I've used with other products.Once it was together, this pressure washer was very easy to operate: plug it in, press the button, connect and turn on the hose and turn on the washer. You can use the adjustable sprayer for focused or low power washing, or you can use the rotating head for a powerful, clean \"sweeping\" action. Both heads worked great and having the adjustable flow was very useful when I used it to wash my car. Typical operation for cleaning the stairs and sidewalk was as expected: move back for a wider, slower spray, move in for a narrower, faster spray. Everything just worked. This one is slightly more powerful than my blue pressure washer, but just as easy to operate. A slightly longer cord and/or hose would have made it ideal, but I don't really have any complaints. This is a good product, but I'm deducting one star for the amount of assembly and the fussy, cartoonish instructions. Otherwise, this is quite a good pressure washer. TL;DR:",

The quick connectors work very well for getting the unit set up fast and there is a range of wands for different applications (including a scrubbing kit which I'd not seen before). The unit looks more or less identical to the old one, containing a holster for the spray and a holder for coiling the cable.In terms of pressure, it's extremely powerful, second only to the much more expensive gasoline washers and better than the previous Karcher. To compare both machines, on a dirty driveway I would have to hold the wand of the old machine only an inch from the ground to create enough pressure to remove stains and ground-in dirt. On this model you can comfortably use a 4-5 inch spread to achieve the same effect which makes the job much, much faster. At a 1-inch distance the new machine will remove almost anything at all.It's a great machine in its simplicity and power and has reduced my six-monthly pressure washing tasks from 2 hours down to about 30 minutes. It feels like a solid, commercial unit and is definitely the most powerful electric washer I've used. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I've gone through a few power washers.  I don't use them often, so I don't get new ones to replace a broken one, just usually I see one and it has a feature I'd like, so I give my old one to a friend or family member, and get the new one.This one looked interesting when it came up in the Vine program, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was winter time when I ordered it, and living in Wisconsin with the winter we've had, I've got so much salt in the garage that I've never seen it look like this before.  In about a 2 foot oval around the entire area the car sits, it's like a small white beach, there are literally small salt dunes in many places.This was probably the biggest pain of any I have purchased to unbox and put together.  There are 19 pieces you pull out, 21 if you count the two wheel covers that were slipped on the wheels but not fully in place yet, and had to be removed to put the wheels on anyway.  Some things didn't line up very easily and required a bit of force to get them into place, and this was mostly due to the barrels the screws went through not going into the holes set in the receiving piece without a bunch of elbow grease and slightly bending things to align them.  There's a little design quality there they could improve upon.I don't like that the connector for the hose is all plastic.  Plastic for the screw threads, plastic for the little rollers that pop out to secure it to the nozzle on the power washer, just plastic plastic plastic.  I've had far too many of these break in the past from other manufacturers. I also don't like the wand's connector.  The hose from the washer to the wand actually slides up inside a deep recessed hole with a cover totally shrouding it.  The hose has to line up a specific way, because of the shape of the plug on it, and there is no marking on the hose to show &#34;line up with this spot&#34; on the wand.  So you have to look into the &#34;tunnel&#34; on the hose to the hole inside, see where the parts are supposed to be lined up, then get the hose oriented this way, and then push it up inside while maintaining that orientation.  Slightly cocking it to one side or the other will mean you won't get it inserted.  So there's some give and take there.  Most places just use round retaining flanges that can be inserted regardless, but this one is rectangular, so it HAS to go in the right way.I was able to do a good stress test of the unit for my first run though, cleaning out that aforementioned garage full of salt and gunk from the winter roads here.  Since we've had an insanely brutal winter compared to normal for the last couple decades, between more snow and more days below zero, we've used a LOT of salt on our roads.  Now that we're in April, and I finally saw a day break 50 degrees, I thought I would finally clean my garage.  Since I didn't even have hoses outside yet, and the faucets outside are still turned off, I bought a short 15 foot hose to run from my wash tub in the laundry room off my garage to the power washer, and just snaked the hose through the garage door and left it open.Once I got past the reset safety on the plug, I saw that it had apparently been shipped in the &#34;on&#34; position.  It's a large 3&#34; or so circle on the BOTTOM of the front of the washer that rotates to turn this on and off.  I like the large oversized swtich, I just don't like the position.  So I got it going, and spent some time working on the concrete floor in my garage.It performed very well, as good as any power washer I've had in the past, and actually better than most.  On/Off with the wand's handle was quick and flawless.  I know my stationary tub does not put out as much water as quickly when compared to the hose bibs outside.  I've had other power washers when, using something with less than &#34;full water&#34; flow like I was using today, would kind of squirt out a little water until you released the handle on the wand, pulled it, released it, and pulled it again, getting enough water pressure to the pump again, and finally the pump would kick in again and it would start actually using power.  I've had that happen here previously using this very stationary tub.  But it never happened once with this unit.  Full power the entire time despite the lesser inflow of water to the unit.Noise levels were about on par with any power washer I've ever owned.  The hose straightened out easily when I &#34;unscrewed&#34; it by twisting the wand to get rid of all the spirals in it from being rolled up, it didn't try to hold it's old &#34;wound&#34; position like many do.  The hose seems to be better than most of the really bad plastic feeling hoses the other washers I've had used.The wand twists to give you control over the size of the spray, and there's a setting for using the detergent mixer as well.  That was another piece of this that just disappointed me as far as the poor engineering.  The instructions show clearly that you are supposed to run the line from the top back of the power washer to the detergent container underneath the handle where this snaps in.  But if you do that, it would kink the unit.  going to the side wasn't a good option either.  I ended up pulling the little line apart and feeding it through one of the other cutouts in the handle, since that way it wasn't compressed and didn't interfere with getting the container on and off.  I've posted a couple pictures of what I'm talking about so you can see what I mean.I also miss the wind up crank my other one had, since there was a hose reel built into the top of it.  But ultimately I prefer this one since as I said, the hose doesn't seem to be forcing itself to stay in a coiled up spiral shape, I can actually get this completely straight and flat while I'm using it.  I find that far more useful than an easy way to roll it up when I'm done.The AC cord has plenty of length, and the hose is a usable length as well.All told, this is a good little unit.  Engineering issues would've made me give this just 3 stars most likely if it performed as adequately as the other power washers I've used in the past, but I had to give it another star for how well it actually worked.  It had no problems stripping the gunk off my concrete floor, or the Weathertech floor mats of my Jeep, or even the floor mats I dragged outside to hose down now that the winter season has mostly passed us up.  If it weren't for how the hose has to line up just the right way without being able to visually see it while you do it for the connector to the wand, or the assembly issues with things not lining up right before you screwed them in, the performance would've earned this 5 stars.  So it balances out to 4, and it's certainly earned all of them. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to use and review this item! We have a deck that requires frequent cleaning because we have bird feeders, and truth be told they are too close to the deck - so the deck gets icky, and I hate it!My husband has a power washer, but it is an older model that looks very impressive and requires more muscle than I have in order to move it. He kept telling me he would  show me how to use it, but when using this Karcher power washer became a possibility I was thrilled that I would have a power washer of my own, and, best of all perhaps, in a size that I could manage.I only really used the vario-speed wand. The &#34;dirt-blaster&#34; wand offers seriously strong power, power, washing capability, and it would easily tackle your yuckkiest cleaning task. I  hesitated to try to use the dirt blaster on the siding of the house bcause the 'vario-speed' wand did a perfect job (at a lower than max speed), and I have a feeling that the dirt-blasting wand would take off all of the paint on the siding in a hurry!Fllowing are the pros and con of setting up and using this mighty little power cleaner.Pros:1.  This relatively petite unit does a wonderful job!I got my deck cleaned  (and it was very gunky after a large part of the winter) in no time! I used the vario-speed handle and it was perfect. Even with the relatively poor water pressure that we have at our house, I got a v-e-r-y powerful amount of pressure. Using the vario-speed handle at full pressure blasted bird bath ick in a flash and then, by changing the pressure, let me fill the bird bath easily. It blasted the seeds and gunk that were stuck in between the decking effortlessly! That was really important because I had been having to use a machete knife to clean out in between the decking boards before, which was time cosuming and very discomforting for me.2.  It's portable and the low 30# weight makes it easy to move about as needed.3.  The cords are generously long, I had no problems at all covering a large area without the need to move the unit itself.4.  Because of its compact size, this Karcher power cleaner is easy to cover and store.5.  Having the 'cleaning solution' cannister option makes washing your car so easy! Just add the solution to the cannister, attach the siphon hose and voila - you have your own little car-ash (or patio furniture washer etc.). It's a very handy feature of the unit.6.  With the exception of the banging the wheels in place, I was able to put the unit together by myself. Putting the hoses into place is easy enough and the unit performs flawlessly and easily.Cons:1.  As others have mentioned, the instructions for the assembly are not very good. They took a lot of reading, and re-reading to make sense to me. I got it, however, it just took a bit of time, and, for a change, I really did need to actually r-e-a-d the instructions.2.  The wheels were especially difficult to set, and this is the one thing that I did need to ask my husband for help with. His muscle power was needed to get the wheels pushed in.3.  The wheels are not very effective in general. They help, but they are v-e-r-y stiff and turn all that well.4.  The handle is not very comfortable. I wish that you keep the flow going without having to hold in the handle constantly. I can live with it though. The handle itself is not ergonomic and, as a person who has already had carpal tunnel surgery once, I would have appreciated a better design for the handle and more padding! I plan to construct some sort of cushioning for myself. If you have no issues with your hands or wrists, then this will be no issues for you!5.  The yellow part of the front of the unit that holds the &#34;cleaning solution&#34; cannister is a bit flimsy, and does not attach as securaly to the unit as I would like.Yes, there are quite a few small things that I consider to be 'cons', but the fact of the matter is that this power washer is really perfect for me, and I am thrilled to have it. I will be using it a lot I know. I am so happy that I will not have to master the monster machine that is my husband's old model power washer!For me the pros of this washer make the cons seem like small things. For the money, I truly don't think that you can do any better. I think that the cons are all 'doable'. I took one star off because of the handle design. That's really the only thing I plan to fiddle with to make more comfortable. Those people who experience no hand or wrist problems will have no issues with the handle!This little powerhouse is an excellent value all-in-all and I think that it will be a very useful tool for anyone who needs a good power washer at a very reasonable price point!

        "reviewText": "I was looking for an electric pressure washer for home use after having had a lot of success with an AR Blue Clean AR383 that I had purchased for work.  When I saw this unit I thought I would give it a try.  Here is what I like:1.  The pressure hose is fairly flexible and the power cord is very flexible.  These may seem like small items, but it they are stiff and difficult to work with it can turn a quick task into a real pain.2.  The motor in this unit works well and it seems to create a good amount of pressure.3.  The bright yellow color makes it difficult to trip over!!4.  Only one tool, a number two Philips screwdriver, is required for assembly.5.  The gun assembly on this unit has a much better attachment mechanism for the pressure hose than the AR383 does.Here is what I did not like as much:1.  As opposed to the AR Blue Clean AR383, this unit requires a lot of time to put together!  Allow yourself an hour to assemble this unit as the parts do NOT fit well.  Be especially careful when putting the top section on to the body of the unit as it does NOT go together easily.  The plastic parts do NOT align well and it will take quite a bit of force to get them to fit together (the top slides into the bottom section, if you apply sufficient amount of force) and if you are not careful you can wind up with a pinched hand or finger!!!2.  As opposed to the AR Blue Clean AR383, the ergonomics, fit, and finish of this machine leaves a lot to be desired.  As an example, on the AR383 the handle is finished on all sides.  This makes for a very comfortable grip when you move the unit or if you have to lift it up.  On the Karcher unit, the handled is only finished on the top and forward facing side.  The back of the unit is open plastic that is VERY rough on your hands and not very comfortable.3.  While the wheels of this unit are larger than those on the AR383, they are basically worthless.  They do NOT roll without a lot of force because the wheels have no real support.  There is no shaft that they are connected to.  They are attached to the body of the unit with a press fit piece of plastic that is not stable.  So, the wheels may roll if there is no weight on them, but apply weight and the plastic bends and the wheels rub on the unit or just do not turn.  Since these wheels are plastic, expect them to wear out quickly due to sliding and not turning on surfaces.4.  The quick disconnect is a joke.  It is a VERY frail piece of plastic that does not connect well.  I had mine disconnect twice while the unit was in use (happened when I shut off the spray).  I would highly recommend buying a higher quality connector because if this comes disconnected while the pump is running you can ruin the motor since it is basically water cooled and water lubricated.Overall, this unit is functional and does work as long as you are either very careful with the quick disconnect or if you replace it with a decent one.  However, I do not see where it delivers a $100 worth of higher performance of gives value for the money you need to spend over and above what an AR Blue Clean AR383 gives you.The two star deduction is for Value, quality of fit and finish, and lousy wheels.I would Not recommend this unit.

For my needs, the best PW is the Karcher G 2650 gas-powered Honda engine pressure washer. This 2,000 psi electric pressure washer is, by comparison, almost a toy. But to be fair, it's a nice, light, easy to use little thing. If you just want to wash the car and spray some dirt from a small porch, it may be perfect for you. By contrast, my pressure washing needs are significant. I live with a lot of animals and a lot of hard, exterior surfaces and everything gets dusty or muddy by turns. A good, powerful pressure washer is essential unless I want to spend half a day hosing down sidewalks, patios, and driveway. My gas-powered Karcher gets the job done FAST. This little electric unit is hardly more powerful than my garden hose turned full force and equipped with a good pistol grip spray nozzle. And there are all those hoses to move thither and yon. Admittedly only one more hose than the gas-powered washer has, but for me with all the space I have to cover, it's the hose that broke this camel's back. To its credit, the Karcher 2,000 psi electric is easier to start, easier to lift, and more convenient to power. So, if your need is for a relative lightweight, it likely will do the job. But don't be misled, if you've got a lot of ground (concrete, stone, etc.) to cover, you may need what I need, the Karcher 2,650 psi gas-powered model. TL;DR:",

It is so light weight that it's great for tiny yards, steep hillsides, or for the elderly or younger kids to use. It's a less dangerousness mini mower with the deck on. You just make sure the lithium battery is completely locked in, push a button and squeeze the handle. As an edger it works well too but with no shields attached watch out for your bare ankles getting hit by debris.The problems: let's start with the battery's. Each battery only lasts 15-20 minutes tops depending upon grass length. So if you have any sizable job it would take you forever to get it done. Especially since each battery then takes about 4 and a half hours to recharge. So 9 hours of charging for 30-40 minutes of work time. Out of the box my husband and I used this as a mower. We each used both batteries once, so there was a recharge between uses. Then I went to recharge the batteries only to get the flashing red light signal that indicated overheating. We tried this off and on for over 24 hours plugging the charger in inside the house. Finally I emailed Black and Decker who responded with a statement that I should be charging them in a cool area ( it was mid May and our house was no warmer than 71) but that since I had a time period I needed to review this in I could take it to their service center an hour away. We went out of our way to get there to be told that this was a known battery problem, they were in a minor redesign and we would have new batteries in about ten days. The new ones finally came- and still when we went to charge them the same overheat signal came on and the batteries wouldn't charge. So another trip to the service center where they finally decided it was the fault of the charger. A new one was ordered. But a second set of batteries showed up instead. So those then had to be mailed back and wait for the charger some more. Now that the waiting game is over the trimmer/ mower is great as long as it has that tiny amount of juice but from my perspective this product still needs a lot of work to make it better for the user.

With its 2 batteries and tiny toy mower attachment, you could get away without a mower if you have a cute little postage stamp yard.I have Black & Decker's previous cordless electric trimmer, the 18V Grass Hog, and it is, frankly, awful. After a few disappointing uses (it's heavier, weaker, and with a shorter battery life and even longer charging time than this trimmer), it got put aside and we switched back to the gas trimmer (or, more accurately, I quit trimming altogether when my partner's away, as I hate the noise, smell, weight, difficulty starting and intense vibrations of the gas trimmer).I've used this trimmer all over our property, for standard lightweight edging of a maintained lawn, for crisis &#34;mowing&#34; of a severely overgrown (tall grass and heavy weeds) large courtyard, and for trimming paths around water and fences in tallgrass pasture. I've used the little &#34;mower&#34; attatchment on both high and normal grass. It's great on regular grass, workable on overgrown.It's great. Light as-is, easy on your back, hands and shoulders. Doesn't require a kung-fu grip to start or keep on, and with the mower attachment, it weighs nothing and you can operate it with one hand with the same effort you'd need to run an ultralight vacuum.I like that it comes with 2 batteries and uses the same battery as other B&D; tools in the same line (I had another battery from a little cordless chainsaw we got for Christmas). I found all 3 batteries to have the following life:-20 minutes on light edging--what you have around the edges if you mow every week-15 minutes on taller grass and heavy trimming (medium weeds, mid-calf-high grass)-10 minutes on every heavy weed and tough, stemmy pasture grass over the kneesIf you let your big, tough weeds get to your waist (which is true on much of our property, which includes a lot of pasture woods), or you have woody weed and vines, this trimmer is going to have trouble. But then, I don't think any trimmer's going to do well with stems an inch around.The one negative is that the batteries do take a long time to charge--4+ hours each, and there's just one charger. We have a charging station where we keep all our tool and regular  batteries charged and ready to go, so it wasn't a problem for me, but would have been in the days before we had our little dedicated charging area. B&D; does make a fast charger (40 minutes--http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-L2ACF-OPE-Lithium-Charger/dp/B009NOCWY6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1403104470&sr;=8-1&keywords;=black+and+decker+20v+lithium+charger) that I will probably nab in the future.All in all, I was well pleased to have an edger that did a good job, had sufficient battery life for all our normal trimming, and didn't leave my back aching or my hands numb.

After about half way the power started to drop and we had to swap batteries to complete the job. Keep in mind this was only string trimming around 1500 linear feet of edging (approximately). This is definitely not going to replace my Tanaka string trimmer, but I'll grab it in a pinch to do some quick trimming or touchups.-- UPDATE#1 --Quick tip for people using it as a mower, it's best if you mow like you would vacuum (back and forth). That and mow a bit more often than you normally would to prevent it from getting bogged down.Also, I highly recommend usingGrez-Offto clean the mower deck and trimmer with after every use as it removes every bit of pulverized grass with ease.Right off the bat assembly and getting the trimmer adjusted was easy and straight forward. Just a single screw was required to get the guard in place and it was ready to go.After charging one of the batteries for a few hours (as required), it was time to take it for a spin. Nice and quiet operation, plenty of power to cut down 12\"+ grass with ease. With the adjustable telescoping handle I was able to get it to fit me as well as my shorter family members.The single button adjustable grip handle allows for a great amount of control and again was able to get it into a position that fit my trimming needs.The 20V battery seems to be holding quite well and gives me plenty of run time to complete our 1/3 acre lot (will update this review as to any changes in the battery charge/run time).Now as for the mower... it has got to be a joke. This would only be useful for someone who lives in the city and only has to take care of a patch or two of sidewalk grass every week.The height adjustment is lacking and clumsy.The \"mower deck\" on the bottom is just cram packed with nooks, crannies, and areas where grass gets packed in making it harder to clean.The only thing that the deck portion has that is useful, is a ring for hanging it when not in use (something I wish the trimmer had...).So if you have a small patch of grass (or two) to upkeep, this will definitely help you out. However if you have a bit more land to mow, buy just the trimmer because it's awesome! TL;DR:",

Maybe if you have bermuda or some other variety it might do the trick for tiny yards.As a weed whacker, again, I have to say it is so so.  This is a lightweight yard tool - the batteries are small and it really feels under-powered to me, but I am used to using a 36volt li-ion trimmer that can go thru absolutely anything i throw it at.  For the first edging of the season, you'll have a really hard time getting a nice clean line with this tool. This tool, while a clever design, is really only suitable for small yards that are consistently maintained.  The only thing I can really say that I like about it, is the edger guide, which goes against the sidewalk to guide not just placement, but also depth, the guide has a little bump out that sits on top of the sidewalk so that you aren't going down too deep and wasting a bunch of trimmer line.I have always like black and decker yard products because they are light enough and sized appropriately for a small woman to do her own yard work - a big plus in my book, and this tool is no exception. However, putting the guard on during first assembly out of the box was unreasonably difficult - I couldn't get it to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed.

It's not as powerful as a plug-in trimmer or a gas trimmer so you really need to keep up with the edging. Also, when twisting it into edging mode I have two issues. First, the wire metal guide is difficult and frustrating to pull out. The old B&D model has one that just flips out which is much better. Second, as you twist the end to put it into edger mode the metal rod tends to come completely loose. With my small lawn this trimmer's battery lasts more than long enough. It just doesn't have the power of a plug in model so expect that before you buy. If you were using this to clear the edge of a field with tall weeds I'd say look at something else. For grass this is fine. For weeds you'd have a struggle.. The mower part of this is just a gimmick. I cannot understand, unless you had a lawn for ants, how this would make a good mower. I gave it a good try but it's super-frustrating to use. If you don't have a mower it's best to mow using it like a trimmer than to hook it up to this silly contraption.

        "reviewText": "My upfront summary - a good mower that cuts my grass quite well, the grass catcher works okay but not perfectly, and the cord wasn't nearly as difficult to keep out of the way as I had expected.  If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won't run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It's not perfect, it's a little bulky compared to what I'm used to, and the handle height isn't adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn't fit you, you're out of luck.  If you're still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I've put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can't mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don't want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I'd always mowed my lawn, it hadn't occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I'd like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I've been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren't fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don't let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn't do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6\") grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it's heavier and bulkier so it's more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don't wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It's a Black & Decker.  I've purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I've overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can't get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won't run out of power because it's cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5'9\") okay, but I'd like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you're shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you've got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It's always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that's both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren't overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn't easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it's easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "** updated with second mow at bottom**I really do enjoy mowing my yard... it's a little more than  1/3 acre and a push mower is good exercise.  My other mower is a 13 year old Toro Recycler 22\" deck with personal pace self-propelled drive.  I've kept that gas engine purring and it's still running strong - Briggs and Stratton make a good engine.  But... it is loud (I mow with ear buds or plugs in) and it's considered not as \"green\" as some current options.  So even though I'm a happy Toro gas mower owner... I thought I'd give an electric a chance.A quick pros and cons for the start here...  remember that I've only assembled and mowed once with it....+ Very light - this is a mower my 6 year old could handle (and no... I don't let her mow).+ packaged mostly assembled - only two Philips head screws to anchor the handle.  The rest is tool-less.+ Significantly quieter than my gas engine mower.  I don't have a SPL gauge, but I can mow without protection and wouldn't get a headache-  17\" deck is a bit narrow.  It sure fits in the garage easy, but I'm adding an additional swipe after every 3 passes to keep up with my 22\" gas mower.  Will be a bit more exercise... and a lawn pattern with more wheel marks.-  Not self-propelled... perhaps this is an observation more than a Con...  It's light, so it doesn't feel like it needs a drive system-  Mostly plastic construction - long term durability?-  Wheels seem less rugged than ones designed for steel deck mowers.Now that we are past the bullets...  Assembly...well the handle attaches with two screws and the upper handle with two tool-less bolts with a hand side wingnuts... they all work well and provide a study feel when complete.The fancy plastic grass catcher comes in 4 pieces...  that's right... 4!  I spent more time inserting tab A into slot B than should be necessary.  The grass catcher is a work of functional art.  Two tone, with a compactor arm built into the unit.  It's a great concept in lawn tech.  I have some concerns over the long term strength over the 4 piece unit versus a molded one piece.  Time will tell if those tabs maintain their strength.  Some additional concerns are the weight.  The plastic catching unit is obviously heftier than a fabric catcher and when full and compacted with grass -- It's likely going to be a lot heavier than the motor deck.  The first spring mow was more of a top off cut than a normal full cut, so I didn't get to witness if the lack of weight in the mower deck and the ability to compact a lot of grass in this catcher turn into a big negative in keeping an even cut through less than ideal slightly bumpy terrain.From a grass catching perspective, it appeared to have less of a \"suction\" than my Toro gas unit.  It would go over leaves without pulling them up into the catcher,  perhaps this will improve when the height of the grass increases, but it's a noticeable different to the gas mower.  Mowing without the catcher in place is possible, but doesn't produce a mulching action when doing a light cut - I will check this again when the grass is higher for the next cut.The front edge of the mower has a molded handle built into the unit.  I'm really not sure of why it's there - the top handle makes more sense.  But with garage space a premium, it looks a great place to use a hook and pulley to pull this mower up and hang it on the wall like my other electric yard tools...  unlike a gas engine; I don't have to worry about it spilling out oil or gas...The height of the mower is changed using a single handle adjustment behind the rear left wheel (its orange in the picture).  When the mower is raised and lowered, the cut gauge on the side reads out in inches...  I think it's great that it is simplified to not have to move each wheel to change height.  Much more user friendly.  My only concern with this method of raising the cut is that it is only raising the back end of the mower to achieve this height, putting the cutting blade at an angle.  This isn't as much of an issue on the grass in the middle of the cut, but the edge cuts won't be at the same even height due to the blade angle.  I don't yet have full enough grass to check the impact of raising it all the way up to 3\"...  but I'm interested in hearing others experiences with cut quality due to this function.The blade had a factory edge on it, which is normal for all mowers...  I'll be giving it a 90 degree sharp edge before the next mow...Handling... I'm used to a heavy mower, doing a little bit of \"Tokyo Drifting\" with a self-propelled unit to slide into the end cuts and radius cuts.  The much lighter deck of this unit is definitely a different feel and seems easy to lift the mower off of its cut angle/depth.  I had to consciously change the way I'm putting pressure on the handle to keep the deck down in walking turns.The balance of the mower feels a little off...  with very little weight in the electric engine and deck and the handle being attached over the rear wheels,  the additional weight of the catcher (especially when full) makes it unbalanced causing the front wheels to easily rise on a bumpy area...  This leads to an uneven cut.  Moving the handle attachment an inch or two forward of the rear wheels should make this tool feel more stable and cut more uniformly.And the biggest difference between gas and electric... the cord.  I've used electric dethatchers and other devices in which you have to be cord conscious, so it didn't cause me too much issue.  But it is a significant consideration in how you mow versus a gas (cordless) mower.  Your mowing pattern has to be cord friendly... and your cord needs to be long enough to support your mowing swipes.  Cord management adds time to the mowing cycle, and even though it was out of the way most of the time, cords get caught up in my shrubs and plants, requiring adept lasso maneuvers to prevent walking to move a cord.Summary?  It's okay.  It may be durn perfect for a very small yard - but that's not my yard.  Even with a light early spring cut, it took enough time additional to the gas mower that it was noticeable - But that's really to be expected when you are dealing with a thinner deck 17\" vs 22\" and power cord management.  The jury is still out on the cut quality - I will add to the review as the grass thickens up.  But the height adjustment angled method is concerning me.  The unit is quieter and gives me green \"street cred\"  if you ignore the fact that Ohio power comes from burning coal...  I'll improve this review as I continue to use the unit this next month.  For now the Gas Toro mower is still hibernating.******Second mow this week at 3\"...  The grass grew like the preferred weed that it is last week with all of the rain.  This time i added a 25' extension cord to my 50' cord to prevent unexpected loss of power from ripping it out of the socket.  That seemed to make my range much more acceptable in swipes across the yard.In the much thicker grass, the lack of a drive engine and the plasticy light nature of the unit made it more difficult to keep a nice clean line. I may just be used to the control of the Toro that makes this easier - I'll mark it off to my lack of skill , but my lines were not very pretty.  Although I could hear the engine audibly bogging a little with the grass cut, the cut seemed clean and the catcher was doing its job.  I could not visibly tell while standing if the cut was uneven due to the height mechanism angling the blade, but getting down to the level of the grass low on my knees, it was visible.  So this mower will not have a straight even cut at max height...  that being said, at that height, such unevenness is hard to detect -- which is the compromise the engineers took for the ease of height adjustment.  At the lower height settings, the blade lowers to level, making a low cut the most even it accomplishes..  when it is the most noticeable.After mowing with it for about an hour, doing the cable dance, and emptying the unit several times... I finally returned to my Toro recycler.  Checked its oil, added gas, primed... and on the first pull it started right up, as if 6 months of dormancy never happened..  I finished the yard faster with the gas mower.So why did I give up?  As I was concerned the B&D; deck is too light.  When the heavy plastic grass catcher was just 3/4 full, it was so heavy that it could not even sit on its own four wheels due to being off balance.  It would fall back and rest on the grass catcher.  This lack of weight down on the front end of the mower leads to an uneven cut due to the front end bouncing, and me always pushing down the front to keep it cutting the grass.It's now hanging on the wall on my garage as a backup if my main mower has issues - but my recommendation is that this unit would only be best for those with very small yards and a willingness to deal with an evolving design that hasn't yet been perfected... to avoid having the maintenance and fuel requirements of a gas mower.

The bar is steel, making it easy to maneuver.2) Low profile and easy single lever height adjustment. The product photos barely do it justice in terms of showing the low profile. It's better to have a low profile for getting under shrubs. It also makes it feel like an edger when edging. The height adjustment allows selection of the cut from 11/10&#34; to 31/10&#34;.3) The bale switching compacts grass clippings and allows more grass to be collected between emptying. That saves time and effort.4) Comes with 2 year limited warranty. Several action may cause the warranty to be voided, such as changing the wheel size.5) B & D recommends that when the mower is off and unplugged, that the blades be wiped with a damp cloth.

        "reviewText": "I have a 6-year old corded mower from Home depot's own brand. It still runs fine, but its all metal construction makes it too heavy for moving around on tight corner during mowing. So, I am interested in trying out the light-weight corded mower from B&D.;Assembling the mower body itself is pretty easy, but putting together the grass collector box is quite a task that requires some handyman skills. Frankly, I think it's a design flaw. You need to assemble 4 pieces of hard plastic shells together to form the grass collector box. The process involves lining up several tabs for snapping them into the matching slots. But the tabs are not aligned and the plastic shell is pretty stiff to adjust. So, some brute force effort is needed. In a nutshell, it's a painful process to put together the grass collection box.This B&D; corded mower is far more lighter as it uses a lot of plastic material. It has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle bar for storing extension cord. Not sure if I want to dedicate a 50-feet cord just for this mower though.I try this mower couple of times. Though it's very light and quite, I know something is not quite right. It took me a while to realize the balance of this mower is off. The plastic shell construction make's it very light on the front deck. The long metal handler, plus the grass collecting box have quite some weight. When I run this mower, I keep getting into the condition that the front deck rises up. So, I end up having to intentionally hold the handler bar a little upward to prevent that from happening. Things are getting worse when the grass collecting box is half full, as it adds more weights and it is even more easier for the front deck to tip upward.One more thing that I don' t like this corded mower: the handle height is not adjustable. For me, the handle bar is a bit too high. On top of that, I have to intentionally hold the handle bar upward to prevent the front deck from tipping upward. So, after the mowing, my hand feel tired.At the end, I still go back to use my 6-year old Home Depot brand corded mower. I won't recommend this B&D; corded mower. TL;DR:",

It's quiet, easy to push and mows neatly. I got this mower out of the box, assembled--and mowed my entire front yard--within an hour!When I first opened the box, I was horrified--it looked like nothing was put together. I slowly began to assemble the grass catcher, and voila, I was able to lift the (assembled) mower out of the box WITH ONE HAND! It's quite light. Once the grass catcher is assembled, the rest goes pretty fast.However, while assembling the mower, I was disgusted with Black & Decker for their low standards: pieces that should have snapped together relatively easily took so much strength because of misaligned parts. They're like the opposite of LEGOs--pieces do *not* fit like a glove. In face, I needed a butter knife to help me push pieces together--more than once. I had to do both butt & chest presses on the grass catcher to have a couple of pieces finally snap into place. Thank goodness I did this in the privacy of my living room. I was sweating because of so much physical exertion (not the worst thing, mind you) to get that grass catcher put together correctly. Seriously, B&D;: Try Harder!Keep in mind: this does not come with a extension cord, so if you want to mow immediately, make sure you have a long one ready.The mower is so easy to push and control. I have used both gas power mowers and push mowers. This electric mower was the most pleasant mowing experience for me by far. The power one is hard for me to keep up with, and weights about as much as me. The push mower I used, a Fiskars mowers, was entirely abysmal: very hard to push and left your lawn looking like a terrible haircut.The one caveat I have is this: cords are a pain! Not just on this mower, but on all corded mowers. If I had the means, I'd totally buy an electric mower run on a battery. But for this low price, if you have the patience for a cord, this is a total deal. Drape the cord over your shoulder and not around your neck. Live and learn. TL;DR:",

Build quality is decent, mostly very heavy duty plastics with some metal like the handle. The batteries chaged quickly and in about an hour I was out mowing. (It came with two batteries and I already had a charger so the process for me was faster then if I would have had just the one charger).I have the 36v weed whacker and also the 36v blower. My weed trimmer is going on summer number 3. That battery is what I used as my back up just to test if the older 36v would work (the manual says they will). That battery has spent two Minnesota winters in an unheated shed, so I figured it would give me a good idea of how long the batteries are lasting. To the naked eye the 36v and 40v batteries are indistiguishable.Cutting power was very good. My yard is a mix of grass, dandelions, and other assorted weeds. The mower went through everything without issue. It is very quite, almost like a fan running on a super high setting. Mower is light weight and easy to push. It says to use it with the enclosed grass catcher only, so I did but next time out I am going to try it without and hope it can mulch.My yard is about 150x50 so about 7,500 square feet. I figure I am mowing about 4500-5000 square feet of it once the house,shed, garage, and driveway are subtracted. It took 3 batteries to get it done. The newer 40v ones seemed to have more juice than my old 36v. I got two full bags out of the 40v and 1.5 bags out of the 36v. I actually thought the 36v did quite well and feel good about these batteries lasting for several years.  When the batteries die, they die and there is no loss of power over time. You pretty much go from full power mower to nothing instantly. Issue is that if you have a lawn needing 3 batteries and you just have the two, you will need to schedule in some downtime as the batteries get warm as they are used and the charger will tell you via red light flashes that they are to hot to charge. I swapped out my 40 for the 36, finished off the 36 and my 40 was still to warm to charge.Overall I really like his mower. It does have some battery limits on it if your yard is big enough you can't finish with the two supplied. (I have 4 batteries now so for me not a big deal), but it does very well considering it is basically runnning on a weed whip battery. It is light, quiet, no gas fumes, and leaves a nice even cut in your wake. Cutting width is pretty good as well. I am very happy with it. I will try and update on how my mulching experiment goes.

I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D;: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H; can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down. When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns.

I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and \"upgraded\" to the MM1800, the 18\" corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn't feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick (the motor blew out and smoked).  I replaced it with aGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerand never looked back - that was a great corded mower and I used it until I found this new B&D; Mower.For mowing my own lawn, I did not consider gas because I don't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I have always relied on corded mowers because I felt the battery operated ones would be too weak and I didn't want to deal with battery management.  Cords are a fine option, but sometimes you do want the freedom of a battery.All of that being said, B&D; really did a nice job with this battery operated mower, and for the first time in my adult mowing life, I think I might be back to both B&D; (and using battery operation).Opening the box, I found the mower in 3 pieces.  The battery was pre-installed (with half-charge), so all I had to do to assemble the mower was attached the handle.  The handle attaches in 2 parts.  You need to unscrew the 2 bolts on each side and screw them back in, but once installed, they loosen with a simple lever.  This allows you to collapse the handle easily for storage.  I have had \"easy fold\" handles before, but this one is actually easy.  The mower is very light, and with a handle on top of the body of the mower, I was easily able to lift it up and put it away in my crawl space.  I could do that with a gas or my previous corded mower.The mower includes two 40V B&D; LBXR2036 Lithium Batteries.  It says it is compatible with the lower voltage 36V LBXR36 batteries, but gives no indication of the performance difference.  This could be important because the 36V batteries are $80 and the 40V are $110.  So understand that you are getting over $200 worth of batteries with this mower and that is likely where much of the cost lies.  The batteries are the new Lithium Ion batteries which should hopefully not hold memory like the old NiCad.  You also get a really nice charger which has \"smarts\" to let you know when a battery is charged.  Each battery also has a \"power gauge\" to let you know how much power is left.Enough about the batteries - how does it mow?  I went outside shortly after it rained for the first mow of the season.  Yes - I was challenging the mower on all fronts.  I plugged in the safety key (great feature to keep your mower off when you aren't around - it appears to be \"smart\" and won't let you just short out the terminals).  I also decided not to bag initially.  The deck height setting is very easy - a single lever adjusts the deck.  I tried on setting 2 and made it surprisingly far until I bogged down the mower (no surprise - the grass was tall and wet).  Most impressively, the mower stopped on tall grass and didn't burn out like my older corded mowers did.  It appears to know not to destroy itself.  You have to actually turn it off and then back on to get going, a nice feature to prevent you from overstressing the motor.  I set it higher (to 6) and mowed just fine.In terms of performance, I was able to mow my backyard with 1 battery and my front yard with the other.  Each worked for about 20 minutes (not quite the 30 advertised).  The mower cuts off quickly when the battery is dead, so no period of \"weak mowing\" when you're not sure if you should replace it.  When it's dead, it's dead.The bag is very easy to attach and you don't need to fight to keep it open like other bags.  It can't hold much, so you'll be emptying it a lot on heavy grass.A few other notes - the mower is very easy to turn and navigate thanks to the wide tires and oversized rear tires.  Unfortunately they are plastic (not rubber or real tires), but they seem to get the job done.  The mower is a total of about 17\" wide, so it will fit into very tight space, but it also means you might need to make more passes on your lawn than a wider mower.Overall, I was able to mow easily and certainly appreciated not having to handle cord management.  If you have a yard that can be mowed fully in 40 minutes and you don't want to mess with power cords, this mower is certainly a fine choice.  All of that being said, be aware that you can get a high quality corded mower (like the Greenworks 25022) for a little more than the cost of 1 battery for this mower.  It makes the decision an economic and personal one - is it worth twice the cost to you to get a mower that is lighter and does not require a cord?  If the answer is \"yes\", then you will be quite happy with this B&D; Mower.**** UPDATE 5/15/2014 ****Sadly I had to knock it down to two stars today.  While mowing, I hit a few rocks which is common around here (very rocky soil).  My old Greenworks mower has a few small dings on the blade from hitting rocks, but it's been going strong for years with the dings.  However, the small ding knocked the B&D; CM1640 totally out of balance.  It started vibrating and shaking while I mowed.  I hit a few more small rocks and it got worse.  These weren't giant rocks mind you, but small ones that I have accidentally mowed with countless other mowers.  As I pushed on, the mower caught a root and it was all over.  The blade literally bent 90 degrees (see photo I uploaded).  It is now trash.  Maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about rocks, and maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about roots?  Both are possible, but all I can say is that I abuse my Greenworks mower and every season it starts right up.  I have hit quartz, granite, and just about everything else in my yard, and it is still humming.So why do I think this happened?  I have a theory - it's a battery operated motor meaning they need to optimize everything to draw the lowest amount of current possible.  Looking at the blade, it appears they have made it thinner and lighter than a typical blade so it spins fast without drawing as much current.  The downside is what I just discovered - a fragile mower that breaks easily.One other thing I discovered - the batteries cannot be recharged immediately because they tend to get too hot.  The charger won't charge them.  So you can't recharge battery 1 while you mow with battery 2.  Another issue!I am going back to myGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerwhere you can read my review of that fine mower.  Once again I left it outside, under my deck, all winter, and it finished up my yard for me today great.  A few minutes with it reminded me why I left B&D; in the first place. TL;DR:",

Sure your using home energy to charge the batteries, but you aren't using gas anymore, and thats pretty cool. If you have a small lawn and don't let the grass grow to high, then this is the right mower for you. Yes, you have to get out there every week or so to keep the lawn from getting to high, but its worth it in the end. I have a small beach house with just a small front lawn, and this is perfect for it. Assembly was straightforward, just stick to the script in the manual. The grass catcher must be attached which I knocked a star off of it for, so no cutting grass without it. It comes with two batteries and they last about 15-30 minutes each. It is very easy to start, and like I mentioned before, envirofriendly! Overall, I highly recommend this mower for those with a green conscious or those with small lawns. TL;DR:",

I own a John Deere tractor which takes care of 90% of my mowing needs about the property.  However, the other 10% is landscaped and pathwayed and very difficult to maintain (especially in summer) with a string trimmer (my tractor would demolish these areas).  This little mower has a small diameter blade and is perfect for mowing on either side of pathway pavers and small grassy patches.  The mower was pretty much assembled in the box - all you have to do is attach the grass catcher, bolt on the arms, and charge the batteries.  Easy!  The only reason I didn't give the mower 5 stars was due to battery life.  I fully charged both batteries prior to use.  The first battery died after about 200 sq ft of usage and the 2d battery died after about 300 ft of usage.  I am currently recharging both batteries and will update this review if battery life improves.

We are in a very suburban area so we have no field of weeds to deal with and our grass is the thin bladed stuff. If you had a big lawn and had to deal with a lot of weeds I'm not so sure this more would be so smart for you. You have to understand that battery-powered mowers are not nearly as powerful as corded electric or gas mowers. If you understand that and don't need that power than a mower like this is perfect. I love that it's much quieter and I'm never having to worry about gas or that darned cord getting in the way (I've had both). This thing is light! It's so easy to push that it makes me wonder how durable this is going to be in the long run. It almost feels like you're pushing a toy. The battery does not last as long as I was expecting. I have two small lawns (font and back) and I am able to get two sessions out of one battery. I would have expected three or four. If you were using this in the weeds you would have a struggle as the power you'd need just wouldn't be there. It has some good safety measure built into it like a key and a startup procedure that a small kid would struggle with. I have serious doubts about how long the rear collection basket is going to last as it seems like it's designed to fail sooner than later. The collection is super-cheap feeling and I have a feeling that no matter how careful I am with it I'll be buying an overpriced replacement in less than two years. I think that a part that is going to go on and off constantly deserves much more attention and reinforcement than this cheap bag. So keep that in mind before you buy it because I guarantee you that it will not last longer than a couple years. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This is less noisy than the old electric mower. The people inside the house thought it was the next door neighbors mowing instead of right outside on their own lawn. The little pull bar is comfortable to hold against the handle and doesn't leave one with blisters.The mower did strain quite a bit when working through a weedy wild mustard patch. The power significantly dropped and the battery/mower have never seemed to recover fully. When working through a harder patch, the battery life does shorten considerably as more power is used up in a short amount of time. Before I used it on the mustard patch, I did the front lawn with plain grass. I made it through nearly the entire lawn on one battery only. Since the mustard patch, it takes a full charge on both of the batteries to make it through the front lawn and the battery power level seems to go up and down (can notice difference in the sound level). I'm slightly disappointed with the decline but the length of time the battery lasts has seemed to hold steady since, and the battery charges quickly in a couple hours so it's not difficult to prepare the batteries in time before a mowing day. A single battery will now last about 10-15 minutes.This is not a mulching mower, and I wouldn't really recommend using it &#34;unofficially&#34; as a mulching mower by leaving the bag off. The flap in the back is not light enough for the force of the moving air to blow the flap around to let the grass be expelled out the back. Instead, when I've tried, the grass gets matted underneath the blade. You have to have the bag on to hold the back flap up. It fills up pretty quickly, but there's a nifty tell-tale smaller flap that moves around at the top of the bag from the air movement. If it stops moving around, it's full of grass so the air can't reach the flap to move it around and it's time to empty it.Overall, the mower is easy to use and it's a blessing not to have to deal with gas or cords. It's light enough I can move it around back and forth like a vacuum cleaner (not the best mowing method, I know). As long as the battery doesn't decline further, I'm happy with it. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "This Black & Decker LST420 trimmer / edger is part of the 20V Max tool system that uses the same line of rechargeable 20 volt batteries. It is a nice cordless trimmer with 2 power settings. The trimmer can be rotated so that it performs as an edger (which allows the orange wheel at the bottom of the trimmer to be rolled along a flat surface). As an edger it seemed to be adequate, although I admit that I rarely do edging. It was really good not having to drag an extension cord all over the yard. The trimmer speed can be set at 1 (for longer battery usage) or 2 (for more power).  The \"2\" setting feels closer to my 110 volt corded weedeater, although I found that the \"1\" setting was adequate for most of the weed-eating that I was doing. The first time I used the trimmer I got about 23 minutes on one fully charged battery using the \"1\" setting about 95 percent of the time.  (My second battery was charging). About 8 or 10 minutes of that time was cutting some grass and weeds about a foot tall. It didn't get bogged down even on the \"1\" setting, which is good.  The box states in large letters, \"1 HOUR RUNTIME\" so I gave it 4 stars since I didn't believe the other battery would give me about 37 minutes.  Next time if I can get about an hour on both batteries I'll raise my rating to 5 stars.Assembly: Assembly was real easy and consisted of pushing the plastic guard into a slot (1 screw) and attaching the D shaped handle (1 bolt).Adjustments: The D shaped handle can be moved up and down the shaft, but the angle cannot be adjusted. The telescopic shaft can be shortened or lengthened. The distance between the center of the motor at the bottom of the shaft (center of the Black & Decker label on the motor) to the top of the handle can be adjusted from 36 inches to 49 inches. I'm 6 foot tall and it feels best fully extended for me.Batteries and cutting line: Two 20 volt LBXR2020 Type 4 40 Wh batteries are included. The manual indicates that it takes five hours to fully charge one battery. The following LI-ION batteries can also be used: LBX20, LBXR20, LB2X4020.  Use only 0.065 inch (1.65 mm) diameter round nylon monofilament line.  B&D; recommends the AF-100 spool:Black & Decker AF-100 String Trimmer Replacement Spool with 30 Feet of .065-Inch Line.Warranty: 2 years for home use.The LST420 works so good that my corded weedeater may just hang on the garage wall all summer long.

Yay.  They're easy on / easy off, lightweight, and relatively quick to charge.2.  Convenient, easy-to-use adjustments. This unit is quite versatile.  With a quick squeeze, the base rotates 180 degrees and snaps into place, thus making edging a breeze.  Another quick squeeze at the base and it's back to being a 'regular' trimmer.  The height adjustment is also an excellent feature.  Lift a little lever and the unit easily adjusts for different lengths. This enables my 11-yr old daughter to adjust the unit shorter so she can get a decent angle for trimming.  She had a tough time getting a good angle using my taller corded trimmer.3.  Very lightweight overall, yet balanced and sturdy.4.  Trimmer wheel.  I've seen a few disparaging reviews about the wheel, but frankly, I think it makes trimming easier and more uniform, too. First, it's a godsend for helping my daughter make lawns look sharp in her new yard-care business (her previous work without such a guide was not pretty).  However, I love the wheel, too, as it makes edging a breeze.  I say if the wheel bothers you, be proactive and take it off!5.  I also like that the batteries work on other B & D products.  I have decided to get more B & D products that use these interchangable batteries, so there will be no more dealing with cords when I'm doing lawn care.  It will make things very convenient.What I don't like:As mentioned, it's not as powerful as my corded trimmer, but it still does the job and I'm quite happy with it.

I should also add, I've been putting the 40 volt to the paces and have been impressed by what it manages to handle. My first day out, I used it to trim everything between a bunch of fruit trees in a lot that was overgrown, thick and full of weeds. It cut grass, weeds and even underbrush like a pro.

The charge takes about an hour (max) and seems to last 30 to 45 minutes. The string does not require a bump which is nice and last through the entire trim without worry.Weight is not problematic although it is not skimpy like some electric versions. The battery is interchangeable with other B&D; products of the same voltage (a very nice touch). The entire machine is adjustable up/down to fit short or tall persons.

And I have to say everything about this trimmer is an improvement.The 20v battery is stronger but half the size and weight of the 18v battery. It charges faster and holds its charge longer between use. And it comes with two batteries! One to use and one to charge.  All rechargeable tools should come with two batteries!It also has a power slide that allows you to control how much power it is using. If you are just trimming grass, set it at 1 and the charge will last much longer. But if you have some big weeds, slide it up to 6 for more power.The trimmer line is automatic feed and you can buy replacement spools that just click on if you don't like winding your line.And I will admit the wheel on the front of the head does look silly, but it works. After you swivel the head around, you roll the wheel down the edge of your sidewalk and it becomes a very good edger, the wheel keeps it at a consistent depth.Overall a definite improvement over the old trimmer and I can't wait to get more of these 20v tools.

        "reviewText": "An adjustable lightweight trimmer that works very well, but struggles with heavy weeds. The 20V Li-ion batteries have plenty of power, and just one (of 2 provided) is plenty to trim my entire 1/3-acre property, including edging driveway and walks. The adjustable length, movable handle, and light weight make it easy for either the GF or I to use the trimmer. Assembly is easy and the unit feels well-made.Trimming works well with the handle adjusted to the correct length. The unit has two power modes, and the low-power mode is sufficient for grass, cleaning up around walls and corners, and the like. I use the high-power mode for edging and weeds. Edging works surprisingly well, with the reversible head and a wheel for maintaining constant height. The height of the wheel is just right so the string cuts into the dirt a little, making a neat edge-- nice enough that I no longer feel a need to pull out myB&D; LE750 Edge Hogfor anything other than edging around tree beds. The wheel also takes the unit's weight during edging, reducing strain on my arms.Heavy, fibrous vine-like weeds are hard for this unit, the longer pieces end up not being cut all the way through, and wrap around the spinning part of the edger (which causes it to stop). If you're bush-whacking, you'll need a heavier-duty unit.But my only real complaint is hand-fatigue. I wish B&D; would come up with an easier safety mechanism than a trigger that has to be held constantly (at least a lower-tension trigger). My trigger-hand gets pretty tired after using the trimmer for a while, although the unit is not hand-specific (so I end up switching hands periodically). A minor complaint is the wheel makes it hard to get the trimmer right up to a wall.Two years ago, I had opted for the Ni-Cad poweredBlack & Decker NST2118because the B&D; Li-ion trimmer at the time was half-again as expensive. The lithium-powered models have since come down in price. Comparing this LST420 to the older NST2118, the LST420:* Has a more powerful 20V Li-ion battery (vs NST2118's 18V Ni-Cad)* Li-ion battery weighs much less, 13oz vs NST2118's 31oz* One Li-ion battery does my whole yard w/ power left over (the 2 NiCads struggled to do the same yard)* The edger wheel works much better than the NST2118's extending edger \"bracket\" (which dragged on rough surfaces, and collapsed back into the unit when pressed against the ground)* The handle slides up and down the shaft to adjust (rather than tilting from a fixed location)* Quieter than the NST2118 (especially in low-power mode)I was an early adopter of rechargeable lawn equipment; this LST420 replaced my Ni-Cad NST2118, which had replaced my ancient CST2000 (circa mid-late 90s with 12V Lead-Acid battery). For household use, rechargeable lawn equipment is a definite win: low-maintenance, much quieter than gas, no emissions, no handling toxic fluids, and a lighter environmental footprint when the batteries are maintained and recycled properly.Seriously, this thing is nearly silent compared to commercial gas-powered units. Also note the battery warnings; it can take up to 10 hours to charge up a completely discharged battery, and B&D; advises not storing the battery discharged (eg, during winter).For household and other light duty, look no further than this great little trimmer. Those looking for heavier use might be better off with Black & Decker's 36V or 40V versions. Commercial-duty users should stick to gas. For my use, this trimmer is perfect, and Highly Recommended.

        "reviewText": "If you browse through my reviewer profile you will see that I have reviewed many different BBQ accessories over the years.  I love gadgets and I love to grill.  I've used a number of different wireless thermometers and rarely grill without one anymore.This one is innovative compared to the others that I've used, because it uses a Bluetooth (BT) connection to connect to the CAPPEC app on my iPhone.  (Search for \"CAPPEC\" in the iTunes store.)  Since the iPhone has way more capabilities than a simple LED readout on a monitor, there are a lot more features available through the app.  Awesome!  For example, if you're a data junkie like me, you'll love the ability to watch a graph of the temps of your meat.So what do you get with this thermometer?*  A small black box that kind of reminds me of an AppleTV unit, only smaller.*  Two meat probes.*  A little screwdriver that you'll need to get access to the batterycover.  (I wish I had found this before I struggled to get intothe battery hatch.  It's a lot easier with this little jeweler'sscrewdriver.)Download the app from the app store (iTunes or Android...ooh, I wonder if I can side-load this onto my Kindle Fire tablet?) and launch the app.  Don't do like I did and try to pair the receiver in the BT settings, because that's now how this device works.  Just make sure BT is turned on on your phone.  The app recognized my receiver right away.Here's a quick note about Bluetooth technology.  I don't recall the precise limits of the BT standards, but in my experience most BT devices have a range of less than 25'.  This one had a comparable range where the signal was good up to about 20'-25'.  That's fine with me, but it means I need to leave my iPhone outside near the grill.  Otherwise I'll have to reacquire the signal when I go back outside.  This is important to understand though:  This thermometer is wireless, but it's not what I'd call \"remote\".  Although you're not exactly tethered to the probes, you can't go inside to powder your nose and expect to keep the signal going.Now about the app...I work for a major entertainment company and a big part of our business is mobile apps.  Because of my job I'm probably a tougher critic of mobile apps than most people.  And although I have a couple of small gripes with this app, overall I'm very very happy with it.  And the genius of creating an app to connect to this thermometer is that the manufacturer can release enhancements and bug fixes in the future.  That's fantastic, because I've used some remote thermometers that were pretty good but had flaws that could never be fixed.  I'm happy to know that this one will be upgraded over time.So the device itself is pretty rugged and durable.  The probes are very substantial and I expect them to last a long time.  Frankly I doubt I'll use both probes simultaneously very often, just because I typically only cook one type of meat at a time.  On the other hand, I've been burned before (bad pun) by inaccurate sampling when I put the probe in the wrong spot.  It's nice to have two probes and be able to poke the meat in more than one location.Overall I'm very happy with this thermometer.  It's actually strong competition for my previous favorite.  The only reason I can think of to use my former favorite thermometer is if I need to leave the area and need a remote unit.  But I actually prefer to hang out by the grill, so that's probably not going to be an issue.Well done, CAPPEC.I was provided this item for review. TL;DR:",

The signal went no further than my very small kitchen. When trying it outdoors the signal was lost at the end of a thirty foot walkway, but our garage may have blocked the signal.Now beyond that, it was easy to install the three AAA batteries with the help of the little screwdriver provided. It was also a snap to download the free application. The App itself is a blast, full of extras beyond just keeping you informed of the temperature. The App also keeps a journal of your last 10 BBQs, keeps a temperature graph of what you are cooking, and has a separate page that keeps track of internal temperature and estimated cook time, although I thought it was showing a very short cook time for me, it actually wasn't all that far off in accuracy. However since I  go by temperature I didn't really  pay close attention to that feature. It accommodates 2 probes for those times when you have more meat to BBQ. I like that it comes preprogrammed with many different varieties of meats and the suggested temperatures for cooking them , both gourmet and USDA. If you want, you are able to customize your temperature setting as well.It was pretty cool later on in the evening being able to go back on the App and check out how the smoking temperature progressed over the course of the day.Can't wait to try this on a big Turkey or roast beef, when it cools down enough to have the oven on for hours again. I am hoping that when using it entirely in the house that the Bluetooth will work correctly. TL;DR:",

The other thermometer I tested had as many features, but was so complicated to use that I almost gave up.Another feature that all of these thermometers share is accuracy. The probes are heavy duty and even the display and control unit is built to withstand the elements.There a few things you need to know because the instruction sheet is scant at best. To be fair, the information is in the sheet, but for some reason is easy to overlook. First, the real instructions are in a tab in the downloadable app. Second, when you go into bluetooth discovery mode you can pair this device to your phone or tablet, but it will not connect. The app does that for you.One other thing that you need to know is this has the same limitations as any bluetooth device. If you wander more than ten meters or there are obstructions between you and the unit you can drop the signal. That is not a flaw in this thermometer - it's part of the bluetooth specification. I tested the unit for distance and mine actually held for about twelve meters, so there is a little wiggle-room built in.I tested this with both a Galaxy Note 3 phone and a Tab 3 10.1 tablet. Both worked perfectly.Other things I love about this include the ability to use set temperatures for either gourmet or USDA for various meats and doneness, or set your own. And the ease of cleaning the probes after each use.Overall I am thrilled with this set. I know that borders on hyperbole, but that is truly how I feel. If you barbeque or grill outside and own a smartphone I strongly recommend this thermometer set. TL;DR:",

Adding marinade or turning the meat.  So very useful.For the pork roast last night, the device sounded several minutes before my app got word of it, but that's all right.Some improvements I would like to see include a container or bag to keep all the equipment together.

It felt like opening an iPhone; there was nearly no wasted space and you only had to unpack parts as they were needed. My only qualm with the assembly was that the quick instructions didn't account for a couple of included parts. They were however referenced in the manual, although in the parts list one part was called the ignition stick but in the instructions it was referred to as the lighting stick (just kind of weird considering how much attention to detail everything else was given). One thing to note is that in order to get the grill to temperature you MUST have the cover on. Even with the cover on, cooking took a bit longer than I was used to.

        "reviewText": "We really like the design of this grill. Its got a sleek and futurist design that not only gives it a cool and hip look but is a great space saver as well. We normally keep our grill in an enclosed screened-in porch and roll it out onto the patio when in use. This keeps the grill out of the weather and hopefully helps preserve the life of it. We've had one of those grills that you've probably seen at the local hardware store. The big double grill with gas on one side and charcoal on the other. We even got the extra smoker that is added on the end of that. That thing is huge and heavy to roll around. Enter the  Fuego Element Gas Grill! Oh what a difference! We didn't need that big ole' huge thing that we've been using. I wouldn't grill at times when I really wanted to just because I didn't want to mess with getting that behemoth out.The biggest feature that we like about the Fuego is of course, the design. It's upright so it takes up little space. The grill tank even fits inside the stand. It takes less space up that way and it just looks better. Its design makes it easy and lightweight for us to roll out of the screened-in porch and onto the patio.The grill itself has a double ring of gas so that you can cook with both on or just one. I like that feature so you can get the grill super hot for steaks and burgers or cook in a more indirect heat for items that need to be on the grill longer.This grill is more like a kettle grill in that the lid comes completely off. The handles are made where you can hang the lid onto the handles when the lid is not on the grill. With this design, you don't have a warming rack. We actually like that because we usually take the warming racks off. The racks are just in our way and eventually get rust onto our food below if we don't remove them. Just keep that mind if you are use to using a warming rack or really like a hinged lid. We had a kettle grill moons ago and I actually always quite liked it so these things are not an issue with me.The grill itself seems to be well built and I hope it lasts a quite awhile. We have only been getting a couple years out of the last couple grills that we've had even though we keep ours under a porch. TL;DR:",

The ring-within-ring design lets the cook put roasts and whole chickens in the center of the grill, and using only the outside ring, create the indirect cooking available on grills that take up more space. For the hamburger and steak crowd, use both burners, turning down the flame level after the grill heats up.  The grill has plenty of area to cook a meal for a group of six people.The grill arrived in excellent condition, thanks to lots of cardboard and some ingenious packaging.  The dizzying array of parts to assemble made sense thanks to charts on the outside of the carton (partially obscured by UPS \"caution\" tape) and in the instruction booklet.  Took about 45 minutes to unpack and assemble.  VERY good looking.There are a couple of convenience features that are on a Weber grill that we purchased at Christmas as a gift.  One is a warming rack farther from the flame than the cooking area, and the other is a scale that weighs the propane tank to tell the owner approximately how much gas is left in the tank.

        "reviewText": "I had the chance to try this grill out, and having bought a number of grills in the past trying to find the right one I took the opportunity to check this one out. Overall, if I were to give it a buy, try or don't buy my rating on this would be a try and here is why.The grill itself is not the cheap. It's approx $300 at the time of this review and for that same price you could hit your big box hardware store and get a number of grills with larger cooking area, heavier quality lid to retain heat and may even have it assembled. Now what you won't get is a really neat looking grill. I mean this thing is sleek. I love the look of the grill and the functionality of how they hide the propane tank under it with a door on a hinge instead of just an exposed back like most grills use.I like the fact that the handles on the side of this grill are designed for multi use, you can for instance hang your cooking utensils on them. You can use them to wheel the grill around or you can even slide the lid to the grill on either side into the handle to create a small wind screen.This is the first grill I have seen with a function like this.So if it looks great, and has nice looking features what is wrong with it?Overall the grill is made out of quality materials from what I can tell. The door that holds the propane take is decent thickness, the handles are firm and don't flex when pulled. But here's the 2 main problems I have.The grill comes with cheap, very cheap plastic wheels. They work ok but I found that just wheeling the grill around the garage the wheels started to scuff pretty bad. As soon as I ran over anything it actually caused small dents in the wheel. The quality of them is just horrendous, I think they should have splurged and given an upgrade to the wheels to make them stronger and more durable. Other grills I have owned have had stronger, harder plastic wheels.The other issue is the quality of the lid. The lid is a HUGE piece of any grill. It's what holds the heat in and if it's thick you can retain a lot more heat making your propane be more efficient. It also does NOT have any type of hinge on it. You pick the lid up and have to put it somewhere out of your way. The grill does feature lid slits in the handles but that really isn't that easy to use when you are quickly trying to get the lid off to flip your food. Yes it works, but on more than one occasion the lid actually fell out of the mount when I was trying to use it. Nothing like a hot lid falling near your feet. Then there is the lid quality. The lid on every grill I have owned has been thick, you can't flex or bend it. This grill however the lid feels extremely cheap. In fact mine was bent when I unboxed it, Not a problem because it was so thin I could actually easily bend it back into shape. This lid should be much higher quality, it should not bend at all. Plus if you look at most grills the handle to the lid is on the front and it rotates upwards for a reason, lots of heat could burn you. Weber grills feature a lid similar to this one where you lift straight up but the difference is they have air vents you can open and shut to control heat. On this grill there are slits cut into the lid so if you are cooking you really should be wearing gloves when putting the lid on or off of this grill (especially off) so that you don't burn yourself.It's a neat design and that is really what you are buying here. Yes it functions, but there are so many things I don't like about this grill. If they would improve the quality of the wheels I'd probably bump this up to 4 stars. If they had a better quality lid with vents you could open/close it would get 5 stars. But at this price point to me there are several other options you could go with.I will add, the grill does assemble easily, took me around 30 minutes. It does heat up quickly and it does function.

        "reviewText": "We've had Weber grills for a lifetime it seems. So I'm used to the standard grill that comes from the big box stores. After assembling and using it for awhile, there are some great strengths and a couple of weaknesses.Assembly was pretty easy although it was a little difficult getting one of the base parts to line up. A little strong arming and it sat in place long enough for me to get the screws in. In the end, there were some chains that were supposed to have something to do with the ignition and another one for the lid but no only did I not have an extra screw to attach it (as was implied in the directions) but I still couldn't see a purpose in them. The directions were sadly lacking here.The appearance is really neat. I really like the accessibility of the tank using the hinged front door panel. This allows us to turn the gas off at the tank for every use. Our Weber has the tank in the back with a grill front that makes it almost impossible to reach the tank knob. The lid and the circular grill base do not line up completely. I'm assuming this is because they are a thinner metal and it is pretty easy to make a domed shape slightly off. But I can keep the lid on without any problems, it is just a little off in alignment. The actual grill is supposed to have a marking on it to show which side faces down but I searched and searched and found no marking so I went with instinct on placement.It is pretty easy to move around but the wheels are mediocre and I didn't realize until after I put them on that there are two that specifically belong on the back and I had them mixed up. And that was a mistake on my part, they were indicated in the directions once I went back and read it again. I guess I was just assuming that wheels were wheels and they all looked the same at first glance.I had no trouble with ignition although it helps if I blow slightly at the gas towards the ignition. There are two burners (you can use one or both). It heats up quickly according to the temperature gauge on the lid. Mine definitely got to well over 500 and I think was 600 one time.What I really liked was how evenly it cooked our meat. We've cooked London broil, pork tenderloin and hamburgers. All seem to be a little more moist and nicely cooked. You can get a char on the outside but even though it is really hot, it seems to do more of a bake to the inside. I really liked how our food turned out and it was enough of a difference to notice.So I like how it cooks. I like the large grease pan although there is nothing disposable about it, it needs to be wiped/washed out. It does collect rain water but so does my Weber, even with a cover on - not sure how though.I like the look of this and the ease of use. I'm sure I will need even more time to make this work even more to my benefit. I am by no means a grill expert so a little experimentation and maybe I can learn a few more tricks. TL;DR:",

No unevenness, even with large cuts of meat.The meat is cooked to perfection--every cut we tried came out exactly as we'd hoped.  I swear, we were on the brink of &#34;trying&#34; to get it to do something &#34;wrong&#34;, but it never did...we tried cheap steaks, expensive steaks, roasts, chicken pieces, whole chickens, various fish, and veggies.  It is awesome!  We have a really nice patio grill (not naming names, but it's a huge stainless one from Costco) and we have not used it ONCE since this arrived, except for comparison purposes.  This one has beat it out as far as quality of cooking, speed of cooking, ease of use, and looks.  Sorry, (insert Costco's fancy BBQ name here).The ONE con I could find is that the pizza stone is so expensive.

        "reviewText": "[n.b.: See the revised comments at the end of this review]First off, this is a really strikingly attractive grill; you can't help but be impressed with the clean, modern, Euro-style look. It's almost futuristic. Call it the iGrill. Under the skin, though, it has a few issues.Assembly: This is pretty straightforward. It'll take about a half hour of your time, and a few extra items: A box or utility knife, a large Phillips screwdriver, a 16mm end wrench (although an adjustable or even a 11/16ths will do as well), and a single quality AA battery. The instructions state that no battery is included, but mine had three- a cheap Chinese AA cell- which went right into the recycling bin- and a pair of \"Kirkland\" brand batteries that followed it there. There is also a stamped steel 16/14mm wrench included, but trying to use it to attach the casters is an exercise in frustration. Use a thicker wrench. You'll thank me.The first step is to unpack the parts, and the makers have thoughtfully printed the unpacking and assembly instructions on the outside of the box (although you'll find a little booklet inside as well.) Slice the box along the dotted line with your box knife and lift off. You can now remove the individual boxes inside, which slide together like parts of a wooden puzzle. Very clever. The first actual assembly step is to attach the wheels, using the 16mm wrench. Next, the metal grill attached to the base with M5 screws, and the tank hanger attaches to the grill with supplied M6 screws. Simple. Attach the \"spine\", a piece of rectangular tubing that stiffens the assembly, insert the AA battery and the control valve knob, invert the whole assembly, and you're almost done. The instructions warn you to DO NOT USE THE HANDLE TO LIFT THE ASSEMBLY which is kind of odd, as there aren't a lot of ways to lift this other than the handles. And if you can't use the handles for lifting, how it it that you can use them for moving the cart? I grabbed the unit by the base and the grill and slowly eased it over.The door snaps into place easily, and is held shut by a pair of magnetic latches. Nice. Slide the good sized \"residue tray\" (drip pan) in, and the flame diffuser drops on to the top of the grill- or rather, it should drop on to the top of the grill, but it turned out that the sheet metal that forms the the lower part of the flying saucer you see in the photo was bent. One side looks like it took a substantial impact, or perhaps was dropped on its side before being packed. If I'd purchased this rather than having received a review item I'd have called the company at that point and requested a replacement part. Instead, I got out a rubber mallet and a chunk of 2x4 and reshaped the bowl so I could finish the assembly and review.Having done a bit of body work the diffuser now fit into the bowl, and that left only the task of placing the grill on top of the diffuser, rolling it across my driveway a safe distance from my house, and installing an LP gas tank.  I got some root vegetables form the house (carrot, onion, potato) for my first test and fired up the grill. It took only a minute to reach 200F, another minute and a half to reach 300F, and a total of five minutes to reach 400. 500 F took ten minutes, 550 took 15, and it never got any hotter than that.I tested both the single burner mode (outside ring) and the double burner mode, and looking at the flames from the vent slots under the burners, I noticed something odd: While the interior burner ring produced a series of perfect little lovely blue flames over the holes in the burner, indicating complete combustion, the outer ring produced an orange flame that was detached from the burner and moved around a lot. That suggested poor air flow, or possible too large a jet in that burner. I tried this with the lid on and off, and got the same results in both cases. There was a light wind, but I wouldn't think that should be a problem with a well designed grill.  The poor combustion may be what my grill didn't heat up as fast as the specs suggest it should; I may have to do some disassembly and checking to see if perhaps a jet is missing, or improperly installed. [Update: I tested it again on a wind-free day, and the flame was stable and blue. But the slightest breeze disrupts this.]Cooking burgers with both burners set on high, I was surprised to discover that there wasn't as much heat coming out of the grill as I expected. I could hold my hand comfortable over the burner for several seconds with no discomfort. But if I placed the lid on, the temperature reached 500F quickly. It seems that the grill really needs to have the lid on for good efficiency.Another detail that concerned me had to do with the wheels- they're plastic, and just rolling the grill over 15 feet of concrete resulted in scratches and dents. These are not the sort of caster wheels one should put on outdoor equipment. If you get one, I strongly suggest heading to your local home store and getting some hard rubber casters to replace them.So while this is an attractive, and generally well made grill, it does have a few issues that need to be addressed before i can really recommend it. Over the next few weeks I'm going to do some comparison cooking tests with my Weber Q 320, which has given me great service for the past several years. If I make any more discoveries I'll update this review.Footnote: Fuego doesn't appear to offer a cover for this grill to protect it from the elements, or at any rate, Amazon doesn't offer a cover from Fuego.  You can buy some loose fitting covers from third-party suppliers, but I found a very inexpensive yet hard-wearing  all weather cover: A heavy-duty contractor  type garbage bag. Thanks to the cylindrical design a large garbage bag slips right over the grill. Mine stated on even through the 30mph+ wind thunderstorm we experienced a few days ago. Just remember to let the grill cool before you cover it!(Postscript: The maker, believing that my unit may have been damaged,  has offered to send me a replacement unit. When that one arrives I'll evaluate it and update this review.)Followup: The replacement unit arrived two days ago and assembly went much faster this time, as I was familiar with the process. Unpacking it, though, I noticed that this one had a dent in the rim of the bowl, too (see photos). It wasn't as bad as the first unit, and I could assemble it without bending it back into shape, so I left it alone for my tests. I also noticed that there was a big misalignment where the gas jet entered the outer burner tube (see photos), even more so than on the first unit. I finished the assembly, attached an LP gas tank, and began my tests, starting with time to temperature.As the grill heated up I noticed that the thermometer wasn't moving- and then it abruptly jumped 25 or more degrees. Close inspection revealed that the needle on the temperature gauge was misaligned, and was rubbing against the face of the gauge. As this would make accurate measurements impossible, I turned off the grill and let it cool. I then swapped lids with grill #1, and started it up again. This time I got the following times:200 F - 45 sec300 F - 1:30400 F  - 2:50500 F - 5:00550 F - 5:45This was much faster than the times I obtained with the first grill. Heat seemed more even, too, even though the outer burner showed a lot of yellow.I like this grill a lot, for a number of reasons. The design is superb. Ease of use is first rate. Efficiency- also excellent. But I'm still concerned about the quality control. Mine had three problems that never should have gotten past quality control: The bent dish, the thermometer needle, and the misaligned burner tube. None interfere a lot with use, but they indicate a lack of attention to QC, and that suggests there may be other hidden problems. It may also be that I just happened to get two problem units from a bad production run. On the other hand, the company was very responsive about addressing the problems I reported. So my advice would be if you like the looks of this grill, go ahead and order it, but give it a very careful inspection when it arrives, and if there are problems, let Amazon and the maker know. They'll take care of it. TL;DR:",

But I have also become increasingly disabled so have been trying some more compact grills. I ordered this since like so many have stated, it LOOKS very APPLE like.Looks verses performance....Being so disabled I had 2 neighbors assemble it for me and as a reward, be the first to cook on it with MY food. The box is in itself like a little puzzle you follow to assemble the grill. It's really funny watching neighbors argue about assembly when drinking a few beers with such an odd cut along the dotted lines layout:-)It took maybe 30 minutes of actual assembly time using MY tools. Add another 15 minutes for USMC opinion sharing that wasn't needed but free entertainment for me anyway. On a side note, I wish Vendors would allow me to choose WHO delivers my parcels....Especially given what my driver has told me about the FUN they have seeing who can toss what the HARDEST off of walls etc......Given the ripped, torn, slashed parcels I have received from UPS I have NO respect for them and would elect to even pay a premium for FEDEX or USPS. Luckily, the contents here were &#8220;OK&#8221; and all worked fine.We had very quick and EVEN cooking/heat. We only elected to cook 6 hamburgers since Marines I know anyway are happy as can be with just good old beer & burgers. Meat was juicy as any other grill I have owned as long as I do NOT flip them constantly. I cook 4 minute on Medium, flip for another 3-4 minutes and EAT the suckers.I LOVE the look and functional design. I am still getting used to using the lid design but I am so disabled I have odd problems with even the most simple things. I like the locking wheels though I can't imagine my wheelchair going fast enough with a lap full food to add to the grill that I could really have much NEED for them?To be honest, it is simply the BEAUTY of this that attracts me to it so much. I give it 4 stars and if nothing fails or no weak links appear, I will raise it to 5 stars. I will also have to buy another LPG cylinder if I keep using this over my other since I am unable to swap out my single tank between my grills and this does NOT come with one of it's own....No big deal, just be aware you do NOT get one included.. The one negative for me and it is sort of a BIG one since I am so disabled is this has no fold up/down side trays of any type. This is one of those things where it is simply built to show off it's looks and for me anyway, a very much needed item is left out to help keep it beautiful. Still, I NEED that so have to use a patio table next to it for this purpose instead. TL;DR:",

Assembly was pretty straight forward.  The size is substantially smaller than my previous grills but then so is the number of folks for whom I grill.The size is appropriate for practically everything but a large party.  The quality seems very substantial and a very reasonable price.  The grill top is very solid and appears to be the one that needs seasoned.  They do not make it clear which one of the two grill tops they seem to have for the same grill. One needs seasoned and the other does not.  Size wise this would be a great grill for an apartment or small area.  There is no tray or table attached which is one of the reasons it is so diminutive.  The burner set up as a higher intensity burner in the center and lower on the outside.  The center burner seems to incorporate the outside burner while the outside burner seems to allow the inside burner to remain unused providing a more indirect and slower cooking.The electronic ignition does not work.  I tried three different batteries and it never generated a spark.  The instructions state to put the side of the grill down that is marked face down.  I found nothing anywhere that said \"face down\".  There was a bag of screws that were very similar in appearance and are not the same.  Two bags of clearly marked screws would be better.  Overall, ignoring the minor issues, it is a nice grill that seems like it should be reasonably durable. TL;DR:",

It provides quick and easy coverage with a long and sturdy handle so you can get the job done fast and get back to your beer, your lady friend, or whatever. I can not recommend this basting mop enough for anyone who does a lot of BBQ such as racks of ribs. You can really slop a lot of sauce on quickly.The heads screw onto the handle securely so they will not be coming loose in the middle of the job. For cleanup, I removed the head and only hand-washed the handle. I hand-washed the head under running water with a bit of dish soap to get the majority of the sauce out and then I tossed it into the dishwasher along with my dishes to get it looking as clean as new again.

We grill several times a week in our household, so finding a spatula that not only does its job well, but washes up easily and is manufactured in a way that you know it will be ok to become attached to it as it will be around for many years to come with its sturdy construction, is good. Added bonus is that it has a bottle opener fit right into it. While I at first thought, well, that would be awkward to use when the spatula is all dirty and greasy from use (and I imagine it would be) but when it is clean and hanging from the grill on it's leather cord and you are lounging out in the yard, it can be a handy item to know is there and not have to grab a bottle opener for those times you are not grilling and just enjoying the outdoors nearby.

These tongs were obviously designed by people who actually grill. In the past, I have kept two different tongs on hand to use depending on the size and weight of whatever I'm grilling, because typically, some tongs are good only for picking up small/light items quickly without losing grip while other tongs are cumbersome to use for picking up small stuff but excel at picking up large heavy steaks and ribs without losing grip on the meat. These tongs do a wonderful job at both. They have precision for small stuff and sturdy enough for the heavy stuff and they grip everything securely so your food makes it to the table without having to invoke the 5 second rule. I detest any tongs that won't lock into the closed position for compact storage and these lock shut easily and securely in addition to having a handy hook hanger so I can hang them on one of my grill hooks for quick access while I'm grilling. I own several grilling utensils from Mr. Grill's product line and I highly recommend all of them for the avid griller.

Short of tearing our home down, there is simply NO WAY to find all the cracks and crevices that these critters climb through, to gain entry into our home. When you go to grab your frying pan and there is both mouse turds and urine coating a pan you used a week ago; when you go to grab your coffee beans from a Tupperware container only to find a hole gnawed in the side and a mouse INSIDE the container, EATING the beans, it's time to use these traps!Before buying these traps, 20 at a time, we tried bate, a standard wire mouse trap, heck!, we even have three cats! But, a cat can't catch a mouse living inside your oven nor inside of a plastic container, so that's where these traps come in handy.I do realize that they are sad traps to use and my heart breaks whenever a wee mousie is trapped, but it's either risking our health through contamination of feces and urine or killing the mice; sadly, WE win and the MOUSE looses!I bate these traps with bits of crushed potato chips and that acts like a magnet for any mouse in the house. Usually we have 10 traps set up at a time all over the kitchen/bathroom, which is the area of our farm house that has settled the most over the root cellar. I have the traps either taped down with blue \"painter's tape\" so they can't move all over the place, trying to get free. And out of the deepest respect for the poor mouse, once trapped, I cover it with a paper towel to cover the remainder of the glue board, place the mouse into a plastic bag, and then place the poor thing into a deep freeze we have in the garage. Within 15 minutes, I've euthanized it as kindly as I can, into a deep sleep. And then into the trash bin it goes. This is also the ONLY trap that can catch and keep VOLES, some of the nastiest most destructive vermin living! We had an endless stream of voles gnaw right through our breezeway into our home and the cats wouldn't even touch them! After ridding ourselves of the voles, we had to completely reframe the outside and inside door trim, which they chewed through like tissue paper!I hate that I need to kill something living in order to provide a sanitary/safe place for my family. But, when Autumn comes and we are catching 3-4 mice per day for weeks at a time, we simply must choose our quality of life vs. theirs. Sorry, mice. :( TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I've used both a light Earthwise battery string trimmer and a Stihl gas trimmer.  I fully expected this unit to be tougher than the light battery trimmer, but I didn't expect it to blow the gas trimmer away.  It did, in spades.  I live in the country and have pasture fence lines, banks and other troublesome areas to trim.  I love the little Earthwise trimmer for grass and light weeds around the barn, house and yard, but don't expect it to do any hard stuff.  On the other hand it's gotten to where I don't want to use the gas trimmer anymore at all because it can't handle the firmer stemmed things like poke weeds or briars along fence lines, which means I also have to go over most of those areas with the Stihl blade trimmer (which doesn't cut the long grass).It's gotten so starting the gas trimmers is hard for me and since I have to stop and rest regularly, I either have to restart them too often or they just run out of gas, so the trimming just wasn't getting done in all the difficult places.  I was learning to live with the overgrowth.  I decided to give this thing a try and am really amazed.When I got the box, I was worried about how heavy it was (that battery weighs a good 5 lbs), but it turned out that the weight is well balanced and although heavier than the light Earthwise unit, is a lot easier to use than I anticipated.  It comes fully assembled except for putting on the helper handle which is easy and requires no tools.  You put it where it's most comfortable for you.  The red string guard has to be put on as well, but fits in position easily and the screws are already started in place.  You just need a Phillips screwdriver to finish the job.  There is already string installed. There is a direction book, but I didn't need it.  Everything is intuitive.  My first battery charge took two hours to reach full power.So out to give it a try.  I was not kind, pretty mean actually, running it through mixed combinations of weedy stuff from very thick new spring growth, to leftover stems from last year.  It was far more powerful than the gas trimmer and ripped through some pretty tough stuff.  The line is surprisingly strong and in my entire session I only had to bump it to extend the line four times.  Consider that I was using the trimmer up against fence posts, sapling stumps, trellis supports and all manner of other 'hazards'.  While the trimmer couldn't cut the woody stems of some things like young trees that had gotten hold in the last couple of years, it managed most things including young blackberry canes, young poke weeds and what was left of last year's growth.  Sometimes it jammed briefly, but then started right back up again when freed from the troublesome area.  It even restarted fine after getting into some wire that wrapped around the head.  I got the wire off and it was good to go again.Regarding battery life.  I really tried to run it out, but it ran me out and was still going strong.  I cut a bank that is too steep for the tractor that is about 80' long and 2-3' wide.  It has folded over mounds of grass from years of not being cut plus new spring growth.  It's really thick, but no match for this trimmer.  Then I trimmed about 100' of fence line that required passes on both sides.  I can't get the tractor closer than about 18\" to 2' on one side and the growth along there includes everything from spring weeds and poke weeds to briars and would be trees, cedars and maples.  The trimmer did a creditable job of getting rid of most, if not all of it.  I did a few more projects and kept looking for others, but I finally gave up too tired to move.  I expect the trimmer had been on about 40 minutes although all together with my moving around and resting I'd been at for easily twice that long.  After reading the product description here, I see variable speed is possible, but I had it running full bore the whole time.  Guess I could read the book :). (note: I did read the book and found the most cool thing: there's a button on the back of the battery I hadn't noticed.  When you press it, it shows how much battery charge you have left.  I wish all batteries had that feature.)It certainly is nice to have the thing stop when you release the trigger and restart instantly when you're ready to go again. When you're ready for a recharge, you press the appropriate spot the battery pack ejects and is easy to remove.  I hadn't run it completely out, but I must have been close and still it recharged fully in less than two hours.I can't speak to changing the line since I haven't had to do that yet and although I had the edging guide down part of the time to keep away from the fence posts as much as possible, didn't try actual edging, so I can't speak to that either.  My overall impression is that this trimmer is well worth the price.  It certainly isn't cheap, but is powerful enough to do really hard work, is easy to operate and has a long battery life.  For me it will take the place of both my gas string trimmer and blade trimmer.  And it will actually get used! TL;DR:",

It's worth it to me though because the machine I had been using for two years wasn't worth a darn.  Another difference is that the power output for this Oregon unit is constant.

        "reviewText": "When moving into my house nearly ten years ago, I first started with a corded trimmer. Untangling and tripping over the cord was a massive irritation, not to mention having to attach several of them together to reach the farthest corners of my backyard.So I upgraded to theBlack & Decker LST220 12-Inch 20-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless GrassHog Trimmer/Edger. This was a major improvement and I was happy with it until I got my hands on the GreenWorks Cordless Lithium-Ion String Trimmer/Edger. The longer shaft and adjustable handle on the GreenWorks made all the difference. The sturdiness and longer battery life were nice too, but I found the balance was slightly off and the trimmer head was never quite at the ideal angle for my arm length (even though it was somewhat adjustable).Two years later, I was introduced to the OREGON Cordless ST275-A6. It was like upgrading from a Toyota to a Lexus. Both very good in their own right, but the OREGON is more refined.I say refined, but in a sense it's simpler. No pivoting head, auto line feed or guide wheels. But I found I didn't need them. The OREGON is balanced and positioned perfectly for my long arms. The bump feed makes for an extra step, but gives you control over how much line you use (plus a more simplified system means cheaper repairs if it breaks down). The dual line increases efficiency by providing a cleaner cut and is better for thick overgrown grass. And because there are two lines, it keeps the vibration level at a minimum, which is great for people using this professionally -- less nerve trauma at the end of a long day. The best part, for me, is the large grip handle. Surprisingly, this was a commonly flawed feature on all the trimmers I've previously tried. But the OREGON got it perfectly! Sturdy, comfortable grip, ideal height, and can be positioned on -- rotate and slide up or down -- the shaft exactly how I want it.If you cut lawns professionally, or just want a better experience in your own backyard, then I recommend giving this OREGON a try.

        "reviewText": "The Oregon MAX Trimmer/Edger  is my second foray into the world of battery-powered trimmers.  I bought a Core CGT400 trimmer last summer and I ended up returning it due to a faulty trim head.  The Core worked pretty well but didn't have power to match a gas powered trimmer.  The Oregon MAX falls into the same category; it works well, but the thick St. Augustine grass in Texas does cause you to have to walk slowly and sometimes you have to go back over the same area twice.PROs-------------------+ light and well balanced+ battery lasts a long time and holds its charge when stored+ no cords and no smelly gas+ terrific edging guide featureCONs-------------------- underpowered compared to a gas trimmer- small cut area compared to other trimmers I've usedThe unit only has 4\" of exposed trim line (though it is double-sided from the trim head).  This is 2\" less than my Honda gas trimmer and 1\" less than the Core CGT400.  I assume the cutting area is reduced so that the motor doesn't get bogged down due to insufficient of power.  The problem with this design compromise is that it slows you down because the cutting area isn't as large as other trimmers.Fortunately, the slower trimming is tolerable because the Oregon MAX is lightweight and the battery lasts a really long time.  I trimmed/edged 800 linear feet of curb and fence of my corner lot and the power held steady the entire time.  The battery has an LED indicator that tells you how much charge remains.  After 800 feet of cutting, the 4Ah battery indicated that it was half charged.  Impressive!The Oregon MAX is well balanced and easy to maneuver.  Being quite light, and having a long reach, it doesn't tire you out during long jobs.  The bump head works well and advances string readily without kinking.  It is a dual-line model which allows you to do more cutting for the same RPMs.The most outstanding feature of this trimmer is the edging guide.  A metal guide swings down and you simply pull the trigger to full RPMs and slide this guide along your curb and you will get the straightest, most perfect, edging I've ever seen from a hand-held trimmer.  It is amazing and it's a feature I wish every trimmer had.  Even edging the thick St. Augustine grass worked pretty well.  The relatively thin line did break off a bit often, but I plan on installing thicker line in the future.The handle was very easy to adjust to a position that worked for either edging or trimming.  Once I got it \"just right\", I could go back and forth between trimming and edging without pause.One thing I noticed while edging is that the debris guard is not that helpful.  The edger threw up a cloud of dust and I was covered in dirt by the time I was done.The battery uses lithium ion technology and holds its charge between uses.  That is really handy as you can charge it and then let it sit without worrying that it will be dead the next time need it.The unit is very well built and seems like it will last a long time.If you live in a part of the country with \"normal\" grass, the Oregon MAX will have plenty of power to quickly handle big trimming and edging jobs.  With rugged St. Augustine \"grass\" (really a vine) in Texas, the Oregon MAX is a bit out-classed.  That said, if you want something light and cord-free, I definitely recommend the Oregon MAX.  And the edging feature is pretty darn cool. TL;DR:",

The gloves I&#8217;ve been using were fabric that was coated with a heat resistant material. They worked, but the safe temp limit was about 200 degrees, which meant while I could pick up food with them, I could not use them as general heat protection mitts.These, however, are made of silicone and have a far higher temp resistance while still making it possible to use them to pick up food. They do have some quirks &#8211; the silicone is sticky, which can make it a bit tricky to get them on your hands. But, a little finger wiggling and stretching the silicone gets the job done. They are also short &#8211; they don&#8217;t go past my wrist. A longer extension would be a useful addition.Finger and hand mobility with them on is decent. They are more than limber enough to allow me to pick up not only food, but roasts and kitchen tools. Cleanup is simple &#8211; with the gloves on, drizzle some dish detergent and then wash your &#8220;hands&#8221; under water. Quick and easy!These would be perfect if they had a cloth liner to make it easier to put on, and an extension cuff (also fabric) to protect forearms from spatters.

Perhaps the main difference in is that these gloves are not lined.  If you never did like those or dislike the feel of silicone, simply take a pass.When I took the grill gloves out of the box, I have to quickly pull them apart, or fluff them up to keep the the fingers and palm from sticking to the opposite side.  It was very quick work and not at all problematic.  I&#8217;d say I have medium women&#8217;s hands, somewhat average.  When I put on the gloves I tapped down between each finger and the pointer after pulling on the cuff of the glove to get a nice snug fit.  By doing that, the EpicDeluxe grill gloves fit much better and I didn&#8217;t have to struggle to get them on.Fit?  Well, just a guesstimate, but I&#8217;d say a women&#8217;s medium to a man&#8217;s large would be the best fit for these gloves.  Anyone with extra large finger or wide hands many have trouble putting them on.  On the other hand if you have very small hands you&#8217;ll swim in them.  They are nicely textured with miniature orange hearts that give the gloves really nice gripping power.  They flex quite easily and I was able to manage working with them on the stovetop and in the oven.I&#8217;m not a BBQ person, but using these in the kitchen work quite nicely as well.  I had no problem pulling out oven racks, a feature I really like, or moving pans.  Unless you have reason to use them for hours on end, they are quite comfortable.

More on this later.Yes this is a great lamp for grilling as everyone has pointed out - but it is also a good thing to keep in your car  to aid you if you ever get a flat tire.  It makes a perfect lamp to attach to you headboard and read by.  It is perfect to attach near your entrance door for those nights that you forgot to turn on the outside light and are fumbling with your keys and packages. It is better than walking though the dark with a flashlight since women can simply attach it to their purse handle (if it is thick enough) A simple tap turns this very bright; almost flood-light like lamp on.It is good if you need a concentrated beam of light when you are working on some household projects.  The head moves up and down, but does not swivel, but it can still help when you need both hands to handle tools and a flashlight won't cut it.Unfortunately for some of these uses the batteries don't last long enough.  Which is okay if you use rechargeable batteries and leave the battery cover off to make it easier to change them out.I experimented and found that I had gotten about 3 hours of non-stop light - this is perfect when used for its intended purpose - but not quite long enough for reading.

To open the battery compartment, you will need a small Phillips screwdriver.  Do not forget to put the ribbon under the batteries because the battery well is deep.  When it is time to replace the batteries, you just pull the ribbon and the batteries come out.The light can pivot in a wide range of angles both vertically and horizontally.  The on/off button is soft touch.  Just tap it lightly with your finger to operate.  This is a great feature as the location of the button is completely flat; you can just wipe it to clean.Limitation:This is good when you grill with the lid open because that is where you clamp the light on.  If you have to close the lid often then it is a hassle to keep removing and clamping back the light.  The solution is to have another place close to the grill to anchor the light on.Other uses:You can use the light wherever you have a pole or an edge where you can clamp the light on.  Great for camping, garage, or even as an emergency car flashlight.Suggestion: This can be made better if the screw thread is wider apart so you don't have to turn the knob too many times to clamp (or unclamp) the light.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.

This model this model is lightweight and comes with a plastic sheath with pen clip. The packaging says that the measuring range of this thermometer is -58F-572F.There are three buttons on the thermometer, a hold button, the on/off button and the degrees Celsius/degrees Fahrenheit button. You have to press down firmly on the on/off button to get the thermometer to turn on. My only dislike in this thermometer is that the buttons are very small and I found myself having to use a fingernail to get them to work as my finger was too large and sometimes I would hit the other buttons. This is why deducted one star. Within seconds you are ready to take the temperature of your favorite cut of meat.  I compared the readings with this thermometer to another digital thermometer I had and they were both within a tenth of a degree. The feature I like best about this thermometer is the hold button. Before withdrawing the thermometer from the food, when you press the hold button it will hold the temperature reading until it is pressed again. This prevents the thermometer's temperature to fall drastically when testing another part of the meat. It also has a nice battery saving feature as it will turn itself off after 45 minutes if no buttons are pressed. It also has a nice chart on the back of the packaging  to tell you what the proper temperature of each of your meats should be.Overall, this is a great value for the price.

It tested accurate within a degree for both ice water and boiling water and reads within a degree or two of other kitchen thermometers I own. It is also reasonably priced at under ten dollars. So, if you are buying this thermometer primarily for testing meat in the kitchen, it's going to do the job and do it reasonably well.However, it's a rather basic thermometer. Its display is fairly small and requires me to use my reading glasses. (I have two kitchen thermometers with a much larger display with 1/2 inch digits. These are extremely easy to read, even without my glasses.)The on-off, C/F, and Hold buttons are quite small and very close together. I found that working these buttons was a bit awkward and required a good deal of pressure to get them to work.Finally, the probe is just 5 inches long, which will be adequate for some purposes, but will be a bit short for getting into the center of large piece of meat, such as a whole turkey. Also, for testing the temperature of meat on an outdoor grill it's nice to have a longer probe so one can keep one's hand further away from the heat.Of course, you're going to pay more for a thermometer with a longer probe, a larger display, and more features. So, if you just want a basic thermometer that will do the job, this is the one to buy.Note: I received this product in exchange for writing an honest review.

Really, the only thing that the Taylor has over this one is the NSF certification, which can actually be pretty important.  This Gogodu does NOT state that it is NSF certified.  As far as temperatures, Gogogu and the NSF certified Taylor were always with 0.6 degrees (F) of each other.  However, NSF certifies not just the measurement, but also that the design meets the standards for being able to clean (from my vantage, this Gogogu is just as cleanable as the Taylor.)  The one thing that I can't vouch for is that NSF would have verified is that it is non-toxic, durable and resistant to corrosion.  Time will tell for the latter two, I'll just hope this sucker isn't toxic.So, from my \"layman's\" perspective on this thermometer, it's great...but having the NSF certification would have made it even nicer.  All in all, this appears to be a good all-around product.  Lastly, as far as being waterproof - both this one and my Taylor say they are waterproof.

I tested my review sample by taking my own temperature (careful to not pierce my tongue in the process) and it came up with a perfect 98.6 degree Fahrenheit, which I validated by taking my temperature with a clinical thermometer and getting the same results.I am not going to rehash the specs and description. I will say that this is an accurate and reasonably priced instrument that does have a few minor issues. First, mine would not turn on when I pressed the on/off switch, so I opened the top casing to get to the battery. I pushed the battery firmly into the holder and the thermometer activated when I tried the switch the second time.The problem I had was not so much opening the case or activating the battery, but getting the top of the readout display back on the body of the unit. After much fumbling I saw that there is a guide hold in the bottom part of the case and a peg in the top. After aligning them (difficult because the case blocks the view when you start closing it), I was able to seat the top and start using the thermometer. For this I subtracted a star because the instructions printed on the back of the retain packaging did not mention it, and it's not obvious at first glance. It may be a clever design, but it's not a consumer friendly one.Despite that issue I do love the accuracy, the fact that it displays to one decimal place, and the tactile feedback from the small buttons. An added bonus for me is some recipes I use are based on Celsius and metric measurements. I have to convert them most of the time, but this thermometer defaults to C.  I can press a button to see what it is in F or the reverse, so that feature is one I love. TL;DR:",

I loved them so much that I bought a second set so I'd have four of the skewers.First I have to confess that I haven't used the mats yet.  I haven't quite found the right use for them, plus I keep my grill pretty hot and these are only for use up to 500 degrees.  The skewers though, oh the skewers...I made a nice big set of kebabs for my family and quickly realized that I can't recall the last time I made kebabs.  Why not?  Because I've always had such horrible luck with them.  I have such a hard time turning the kebabs without just having the chunks of stuff twirl around on the skewers.  So the food cooks unevenly and a lot of the pieces even fall off.  That's no good at all.  But these skewers loop around on themselves to make a complete ring, which means that it's very simple to turn them over:  just grab the pointy end with your tongs and gently turn the whole business over (use a spatula to support the other end if you're worried about being too rough with them).These wire skewers are nice and long.  Each one is the equivalent of two or two and a half of the regular wooden skewers that we typically use.  So each one makes a perfect serving for one family member.I had a few fears with these loopy skewers:1) They'd be too hot to handle.2) They'd be too tough to clean.3) They'd be too unwieldy to store.I used tongs and a spatula to take everything off the grill.  Then I figured I'd need my heavy duty BBQ mitt to hold one end while I wrestled the kebabs off the lines, but by the time I got them into the kitchen and got down to business they had already cooled off.  Awesome!Then when it was time to do dishes I just soaped them up and used a sponge to scrub them.  They cleaned right up!When I was all done, I just coiled them up on themselves and they made a bundle about 6\" in diameter.  They fit in my BBQ cupboard just fine.Like I mentioned before, I got a set of these for free to evaluate, but I loved them so much that I bought another set so I'd have four for my family.

These mats are not suitable for conventional outdoor grilling, where high heat and licks of flame are part of the process. These mats are suitable to use in place of parchment paper on your cookie sheets.I grill because I want to create nice crusty sear marks on my foods, whether it be steaks, burgers, kabobs, veggies, seafood or fish. Even when I need to cook foods at a lower-than-high temperature, I still start out by searing the outside. Why bother grilling if that is not the result you are looking for?When I grill over fire (wood or charcoal), even when I try to prevent flare-ups, they happen. And when I crank up the Weber gas grill, it heats to well-over 500 degrees before I toss on the food. Same with my Char Broil infrared grill.The mats are basically like a Silpat mat.Mats are NOT suitable for live fire grilling: Why? Because you can NOT allow flame to touch them.Mats are NOT suitable for searing: Why? Because you can NOT allow temperature to go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.With these mats, you will definitely prevent your grill grates from getting messy, but you will never be able to create a Maillard Effect (caramelization), because you will never be able to get the mats hot enough to create a sear. And, if you've used a marinade, and if your food becomes juicy, the liquid will run off the mat because there is no lip....Hmmmm.....So you will still get flare-ups and you will still get your grates messy.ABOUT THE SKEWERS: They, also, are limited in use: The tips are rounded, not pointy and sharp for easy piercing. These rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies. Forget trying to skewer tomatoes, onion rings, peppers or shrimp. Take a close look at the middle picture, you can see how rounded the tips are. Also, notice that the tips are a bigger diameter than the rest of the skewer. What that means is this: You thread the food over the tips and create a big hole. Then you slide it onto the very pliable thinner cable. Your food will definitely NOT hold in place. It swings around and flops around on the narrow cable, because it started out by going through a big hole.And I'm not sure how this replaces aluminum foil or how it can be used effectively for roasting: Foil wraps any way you want it to, and it can keep fluids contained so you don't lose the juices and so you don't dirty a pan. These mats are flat and will always be flat and fluid will run right off of it.All around this is a very bad idea for the grill.*I received a sample product from TeiKis for review, and I'm not a wimp and not afraid to hand out one-star reviews when they are warranted. If I had paid money for this crap, I would be livid right now.

I'm thinking they might be useful in the bottom of my oven when I bake items that could spill over.These are handy items but they do come with restrictions: store flat, they cannot be placed over flames, should not be heated above 500 F & don't use sharp utensils on the mat.The stainless steel skewers are flexible so you can arrange them around the food that's cooking on the grill. But, the tips are  rounded which makes it hard to pierce food items.review sample provided TL;DR:",

Not only that the mat is easy to clean because it performs like Teflon that almost nothing sticks into it, but the biggest advantage is it prevents your grill from getting dirty.  As you know the soot, the grease, etc. are one of the toughest grime to clean.- As long as you keep grease from dripping below, there is no flare-up.Cons:- You cannot let fire (or exceeds 500 degrees F) from touching the mat- Searing is almost impossible to achieve because you have to make sure you don't let the temperature exceed 500 degrees plus the fact that the mat practically converts the grill into an oversized frying pan.  The juices and the oil remains on the meat on the mat which makes it fried and not grilled.The skewer:It includes a pair of skewers.  The skewer might be the most durable skewer you will ever own (aside from a pure metal spits).  It is indestructible.  It is made of braided metal cable with solid metal tips.  The tip is rounded which makes it difficult to poke meat on it and makes big holes on veggies.  It is pretty long so you have to loop it or bend it around the grill surface to fit.  Also makes it hard to turn because the metal conducts heat. Lastly, I find pleasure on eating on a stick, which is something you probably find hard to do with a 27\" long skewer.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "I got the chance to try out the TeiKis BBQ grill mat and metal skewers this weekend, and they worked out better than I expected. Keeping in mind that I'm not a BBQ expert (and I've never tried to grill veggies before), the results were pretty good.The sheets are a thin Teflon-based (PTFE-coated) pad that you toss on the BBQ to heat/roast/cook whatever you have in mind. I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees. When I got done with the grilling (complete with sizzling marinade), the veggies were nicely singed and soft. It's a little hard to work with the sheet right off the grill, as there's no real structure or stiffness to it. I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl. Washing was a little strange (hand-washing), as it was hard to scrub it down to make it feel completely clean. On the next pass, I'll probably run it through the dishwasher.The skewers were a bit more iffy for me. It was better for larger chunks, as the &#34;sharp end&#34; is more blunt than the typical wooden skewers. I liked how you can shape the skewer around the grill based on the flexibility of the wire. I had to be careful when moving them around, as they *do* conduct heat better than wood. I also had to remove the food from the skewer before serving, as a looping wire doesn't quite have the same visual pizazz as individual wooden skewers.I'll definitely be adding more grilled veggies into my routine by using the TeiKis mats. I'm not sure how much I'll use the skewers, but I still like the idea of having them around if needed.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free TL;DR:",

Grill covers I have had in the past has been thick plastic that when the weather got cold, they were difficult to get on the grill because they lost some of their elasticity. They sometimes ripped when they got this cold. This cover, I think, will not have this problem.The reason is that the fabric material of this cover is very thin. Although it is lightweight, it does seem durable. The product description says that the microporous membrane technology provides 100% waterproof protection and enhanced breathability to prevent trapped moisture and that the corrode Blok Active Vapor Corrosion Inhibitor (VCI) Technology reduces rust and corrosion, extending the life of your grill. I hope that this is the case. It fits very nicely over my Weber Spirit E-310.

It looked about the size of a small canvas shopping bag and was no heavier, either. But once opened, it unfolded into a crisp, light, expansive grill cover, which I put to work immediately on my barrel-shaped, iron charcoal grill.The cover fit right over the top with plenty of room to spare, and because it is so light, I had some qualms about how I might fasten it to keep it from blowing away. Fortunately, it has two sets of Velcro closures, one at each end of the cover, which allowed me to tighten its grip on my grill and hold the cover in place. The roominess also gives me enough space to accommodate the attached smoker chimney without compromising the length and therefore, still able to cover both front and back of the grill all the way down to the deck top. The cover looks great and I love the color, texture and lightness. Because it is so roomy, removing it was a breeze as well and the lightweight fabric makes it easy to fold up and store until you are ready to pop it back over the grill. And sure, all it has to do is keep the rain and bugs out, but, it&#8217;s doing that, so as long as it looks nice, there&#8217;s nothing much I can complain about.Amazon requires that I assess this product within 30 days, so I&#8217;m not able to comment on the purported rust proofing capabilities, but since it is a Rustoleum product, I have no reason to doubt the claim. As a matter of fact, with the onset of rust quite noticeable  on my charcoal grill, I have every expectation that this grill cover will prolong the grill&#8217;s serviceable life. At the very least, it looks good, is well made and easily fits over my grill, so I have no reason to give it less than the full five stars. TL;DR:",

First I tried it on the lawn tractor.  It covered everything except the wheels just fine, and stayed in place great.  It just fit, so it wouldn't fit a larger tractor.Next, I tried it on the grill.  This is an average-sized, 50\" wide 3-burner grill.  It fit over the top okay, though it didn't quite cover the base.  It was about 1-2\" too short.  Then I tried fastening the velcro straps on each side just under the side shelves to keep it in place.  On one side they fastened fine, but on the other the slightest pull on one and it came right off.  As a test I tried the other also - it came off with only a little more force, a little less than what it takes to tear a sheet of paper out of a spiral notebook.The picture on the product page doesn't match the one I received.  For one thing, it doesn't show the 2 straps on each side, so maybe they were a last minute change; without them the cover can slide around, and might even blow off in windy conditions, esp. on small to medium grills.  The side without the straps is billowing a bit right now outside in moderate wind.  Also, the seams on mine are completely different.  The fabric looks similar, but mine has heat welding seals all along the bottom edge.I pulled the cover out to one side and measured it; it would just barely fit a 60\" wide grill of average depth and height, though it might be a very tight fit.The material itself seems medium-weight, has heat-welded seems and a cloth feel.

The product photos show a few uses too.Turn it on by tapping the painted on/off switch on top of the light.It lights up the entire grill area, but it's not just for grilling, we  found several uses for it...hubby sometimes uses it as a work light.At one point, we didn't think we'd be able to get the battery cover off. The screw is very tight & requires a small Phillips head screw driver to remove it. Hubby has more patience that I do, and he finally got the cover off.Nice product, with many uses.review sample provided TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "It seemed proper to open with a Jimmy Reed lyric in my title because the light this puts out is pretty bright. When I was offered a review sample I did not have grilling in mind. The clamp looked like it would fit a microphone stand and that is what inspired me to undertake a review.When I first received it I could not believe that the on/off marking on the top of the lamp was a real switch. It looked as though it was painted on the casing, but someone forgot the switch. After loading it with batteries a mere touch of the marking switches the light on and off. It's pretty clever actually and one of the reasons why I gave it five stars.The battery compartment requires a small Phillips head screwdriver to access the compartment. It's a pain, but it has a purpose: it keeps the compartment waterproof. I tested that by actually submerging the light in a sink basin filled with water. It remained lit and was no worse from my experiment after I removed it and dried it off. So if you do use this for outdoors grilling and forget to bring it back in, it will probably survive the elements for months.I use mine as a handy flashlight that I can conveniently affix to a mic stand. When I need to illuminate a section of a dimly lit stage, a few turns on the clamp screw releases it and I can use it as a conventional flashlight. It is actually strong enough to be a close-in work light for minor repairs in the dark. In fact, it has a lot of uses far beyond what it was designed to do.Normally I donate review samples after I evaluate them, but this one is a keeper. TL;DR:",

The remaining products I pick because it's something I can actually use. I BBQ about 10 times a month. We're late eaters, so it's often after dark. I've tried solar landscape lights and goose-neck lights, headlamps and penlights gripped in my teeth.This light is simply great. It clamps on to the lid-handle and is designed to point over and down to the grilling surface. It has a capacitance button, so there's no physical switch. On my large Weber it lights the entire grill evenly and with plenty of light. I tried the light indoors - it nicely lit a 12x24 foot room!  Again, it's a flood - not a spot, so it's a very wide beam. There's two clusters of five LED lights powered by 3 AA batteries (not included.)One thing to be aware of: It is NOT waterproof. I left it out in the rain and it filled with water. Had to dismantle and let dry so it would work again. TL;DR:",

        "reviewText": "The Ouddy meat claws are much better and easier to use than the metal bear claw lifters with only four tines. Those are probably better for lifting rather that flipping and shredding. These meat claws have six sturdy tines and even though they aren&#8217;t made of metal, do a great job shredding meat. They also work well for holding down a piece of meat while slicing.I haven&#8217;t tried scooping charcoal in or out of the grill, but no doubt they would work well for that. The tines themselves are approximately 1-3/4&#8221; long and the entire &#8220;paw&#8221; is a full 4-1/4&#8221; wide. The tips of the tines are quite sharp and easily stab and hold anything I tried. The plastic is quite solid and I was easily able to grip and work them both in tandem. No learning curve here.If you are into pork pulling and are no pro with a couple of forks, these will work quite nicely. I even tried using them as mixers and even though they are shorter than a salad fork and spoon set, they worked quite well. Actually a bit better because I was able to toss a salad quickly and easily. Less lettuce and salad fixings were rolling off to the side because these claws are wide. A bit of an unconventional use for the Ouddy meat claws, but whatever works.There are probably a ton of uses for the Ouddy claws and I saw a couple of interesting suggestions here and there. For example, one was for grabbing potatoes out of the oven. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve burned my fingers snagging baked potatoes out of the oven. I think the Ouddy meat claws, which aren&#8217;t solely for use with meats, will be making their way into my cupboard to try next time there&#8217;s a turkey in the oven.Sample provided for review.
